she said, "time is a healer"
that remains to be seen
she said, "life's full of wonder"
but never had those dreams...

"why can't you ease my pain?"
the king laid down the crown
"do you see the tempting demon?"
his grinning makes him frown...

all that you love
all that you hate... is lost
all you destroy
all you create... is gone

he was left with nothing
she left him standing here
no pictures of delight
the king was blind with fear...

he tried to find the strength he needs
to calm the doubts of his belief
as darkness falls, the waves roll by
he's not afraid to die...

all that you love
all that you hate... is lost
all you destroy
all you create... is gone
