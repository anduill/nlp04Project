Your love’s like faith,
Your love’s spite in your eyes from those battle days.
There’s still one way,
Abandoned now no matter what you say.
Just one truth,
Moving up to decide that’s your battle move,
No one’s here,
Some phantoms realised that’s your only fear.
You’re sending me rockets,
Fools circle again,
More than I realised.

You’re sending me rockets.
Full circle again.
Still sending me rockets.

I could still cut through,
A war machine with its missiles set on you.
I still want you,
Misty eyes clear to find another view.

And still you’re sending me rockets.
And I surrender again,
No more will I feel this time.

You’re sending me rockets.
Fools circle again.
Still sending me rockets.
Fools circle again.

Home sweet home,
No idea of divides or where the peace has gone.
No words to blame,
Surrender leaves me in the dark again.

You’re sending me rockets,
Fools circle again,
No matter how I plead this time.

You’re sending me rockets,
Fools circle again,
More than I realised.

You’re sending me rockets.
You’re sending me rockets.
Keep sending me rockets.
Still sending me rockets.
Fools circle again
