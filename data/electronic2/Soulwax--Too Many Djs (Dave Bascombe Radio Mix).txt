everybody wants to be the dj
everybody thinks it's oh so easy
you think you belong and you come on strong,

but I can still tell the right from the wrong.

I could never be that kind of girl
nobody takes the time to turn
you always act as if it's understood,
but sweet revenge is finger-lickin' good

if only I could sell myself
the way that even I would buy
if only I could sell myself 
the way that even I would buy

Something's got to give 
'cause I don't know

Here's one thing how to understand me
loneliness tastes like cotton candy.
You answer "I love you" with "I know",
never check the messages on your answerphone

if only I could sell myself
the way that even I would buy

Something's got to give
'cause I don't know
