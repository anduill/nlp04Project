Killing time

Killing gain

Watching our own distortion



Free minds

Free hands

Full of hate

Hand insertion



Killing God

Killing me

Killing, killing

Kill for free



Genocide

Suicide

What's the use of our existing



Deliver us from evil

Deliver us from pain

Deliver us from evil

And forgive us all our sins
