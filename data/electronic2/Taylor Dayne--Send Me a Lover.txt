I wasn't searching
To end this hurting
But out of nowhere
You made me feel

I cried about it
I lied about it
And tired to doubt
This could be real

You've touched me far too much
I'm letting go of all the pain
I'm into you in every way

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone that I can hold
(Baby, now)

Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold

And give me back
What I've been missing
All the love that lies and waits inside your heart

It still astounds me
The way you found me
It's almost too good
To be true

From our first meeting
I had the feeling
The rest of my life
I'd spend with you

I just can't turn my back
On everything I've heard you say
I'm into you in every way

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone that I can hold
(Baby now)

Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away the cold

And give me back
All that I've been missing
All the love that lies and waits inside your heart

I thought that love was only a word, I'd never feel
All the passion, I hold inside, simply just a dream, yeah
'Cause out of your heart you gave to me
I know it's real, oh 'cause I've fallen so in love with you

Send me a lover
Someone to believe in
Please send me someone that I can hold

Send me a lover
A new beginning
Someone to take away my cold

And give me back
All that I've been missing
All the love that lies and waits inside your heart
