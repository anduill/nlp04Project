Light comes
Like a flicker in my left eye
Push, move
Would be perfect if you'd walk by

I've got lots of pictures in my head
You better not turn off the projector, oh
I've got lots of pictures in my head
You better not save them all for later

Maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Could take your picture
Oh, you could get one too
And maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Keep me on, don't switch me off, oh

You can't fight
Oh, what we do what we
Can't do it solo
But you've got what tickles for me

I've got lots of pictures in my head
You better not turn off the projector, oh
And I've got lots of pictures in my head
You better not save them all for later

Maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Could take your picture
Oh, you could get one too
And maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Keep me on, don't switch me off

Maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Could take your picture
Oh, you could get one too
And maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Keep me on, don't switch me off, oh

Keep me on, don't switch me off
Keep me on, don't switch me off
Keep me on, don't switch me off
You better not turn off the projector

Maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Could take your picture
Oh, you could get one too
And maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Keep me on, don't switch me off, oh

Maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Could take your picture
Oh, you could get one too
And maybe I
Oh, get me on fire
Keep me on, don't switch me off, oh
