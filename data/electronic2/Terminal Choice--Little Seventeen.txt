You´re staring at me with this tender look 
You´re smiling at me, promise me everything 
I don´t like the way you talk 
I don´t like the way you walk 
I don´t like what you do 
I´m falling away from you 

Your love´s not what I´m looking for 
I don´t wanna be hurt no more 
I feel like sacrifice my soul 
for a girl that´s just pretending 
You don´t know what it means to love 
You don´t know what it means to hate 
You don´t know what´s it all about 
and you will never understand 
Little seventeen 
Don´t turn your back on me 
My little seventeen 
I won´t forget the things we had 

You´re talking to me with your sweetest voice 
But you´re still hurting me 
cause you don´t understand 
Can´t you hear the words I say? 
Do you really like the game I play? 
Don´t you think that I´m too strong? 
Loving me - it seems so wrong 

I´m running away from you 
I´m running away from you 
I´m running away from all the 
stupid, stupid things you do 
Never turn your back on me 
You´re just too young
