Mother
What have I done?
Just killed the one I loved
Mother
These hands, this gun
After all the love has gone

No restraint
Just pain, remove this cancer
No remorse
Just die, revolt in anger

Mother

Mother
This must be hell
The blood recalls the smell
Mother
This can't be true
After all I did for you

No restraint
Just pain, remove this cancer
No remorse
Just die, revolt in anger

Mother

You didn't want me
You didn't need me
You didn't love me
You did abuse me

Mother 
Cry for mother
