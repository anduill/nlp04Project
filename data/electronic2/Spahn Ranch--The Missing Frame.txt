Listen to the voice
As it says
Sorting through the pretense
And how this scene made sense
The missing frame
And how this scene made sense
Staring into silence
I hear too late
From too many mouths in your field
And how this scene made sense
The pattern is so tense
Push away
For a new life
Another year
The wait
Will seem anew
Gone are two
They are perfectly placed
Push away
For a new life
Another year
The wait
Will seem anew
Gone are two
They are perfect
In the game of chess
A move, a take
A flush in time
A straight
And how this scene made sense
The missing frame
And how this scene made sense
The missing frame
Staring into silence
I hear too late
From too many mouths in your field
And how this scene made sense
The pattern is so tense
Push away
For a new life
Another year
The wait
Will seem anew
Gone are two
They are perfectly placed
Push away
For a new life
Another year
The wait
Will seem anew
Gone are two
They are perfect
And how this scene made sense
The missing frame
And how this scene made sense
Staring into silence
