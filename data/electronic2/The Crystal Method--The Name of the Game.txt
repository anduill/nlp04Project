Yo 
Top of the crown 
Rape the queen 
The fatal mistake in your cradle 
Can't shake the dreams of 
Fire inside of your phonograph 
Battered with gas 
And give you room to breathe 
Through an adequate mask 

Everybody in front 
Let me see ya pumpin' ya fists 
If you up in the back room 
When you rockin' with this 

Come on 

Keepin' ya speaker knockin' 
Jumpin' bangin' bumpin' blazin' Hot 
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks now
Yo yo 
Callin' all freaks
Callin' all freaks now

Get em up in the back room
