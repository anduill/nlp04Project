The wind has settled in the north
The lightning strikes without remorse
All skies are grey and I feel cold
Would you lend me a hand to hold?

Would you save me with loving care?
When I lay my ambitions bare?
I am convinced that you rescue me
From infernal hell you set me free

Tonight the stars are coming soon
I turn my eyes up to the moon
I see you through rose-coloured skies
Your silhouette sparkles and shines
Rose-coloured skies

A glowing fire
A blaze of fame
Flags of glory
God's domain
Rose-coloured skies
