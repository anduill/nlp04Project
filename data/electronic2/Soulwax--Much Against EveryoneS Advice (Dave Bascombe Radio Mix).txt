I
seem to have a history 
at missing the point
at this stuff
apparently
very absentmindedly
I care
but never enough
for
you 

TIME -to put the record straight 
TIME -to stop communicating
please anticipate

AND I'M TRYING TO COMPREHEND THE THINGS I WRITE
AND I'M LIVING THE LIE THAT I CANNOT SATISFY
MUCH AGAINST EVERYONE'S ADVICE
I'M STILL TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING

faith
cheated me of everything
but I laughed until
I stopped
publicly
very, very openly
I sat alone with my thoughts
for
you

TIME-to put the record straight 
TIME-to stop communicating
please anticipate

AND I'M TRYING TO COMPREHEND THE THINGS I WRITE
AND I'M LIVING THE LIE THAT I CANNOT SATISFY
MUCH AGAINST EVERYONE'S ADVICE
I'M STILL TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING I'M TRYING
