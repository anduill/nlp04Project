It's the distance between us
And the space inside ourselves
Abandoned hope - no answers
We have forsaken ourselves

All the sorrows we have suffered
All the shadows we have seen
A pressurehurts inside us
We have erased the golden dream

Fill this emptiness with movement
Fill this cold dark with light
Where's the harbour in the tempest?
A place for us to hide?

Chorus:
I'm quivering
I'm shivering
I'm shuddering
I'm shaking with cold
A thousand dreams
A thousand years
A thousand moments
A thousand tears
A thousand dreams
All slip away
We are benumbed
I can't find my way
