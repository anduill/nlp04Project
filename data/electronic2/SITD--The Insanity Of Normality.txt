My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone,
In fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others,
I want no one to escape,
But even after admitting this there is no catharsis,
My punishment continues to elude me
and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself,
No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling,
This confession has meant nothing
