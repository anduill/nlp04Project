As we step out there into this beautiful land
We can fly away
Through the thrill as time evolves
Love, keep moving on

On a place, in a time
In a space, in my mind
In a dream, far away
In a land where we could stay

I wanna show you a love everlasting
Take you a place where you've never been
Where oceans and rivers cannot separate us
Bring us together, we are one

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ah

Give me the world
Give me the world in my hand
Give me the world
Give me the world in my hand

Always here, always there
Where we go, anywhere
Do the things that we do
No-one around, just me and you

Come, everybody, and gather together
Eagles and sparrows fly away
The roses of love, oh, they bloom all around us
Every nation, we are one

I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ah
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-ah

Give me the world
Give me the world in my hand
Give me the world
Give me the world in my hand

Give me the world
Give me the world in my hand
In my hand
