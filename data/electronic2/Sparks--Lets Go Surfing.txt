Rain is pouring down
In our land-locked town
Skies are always gray
Let's go surfing, babe
Somewhere there is hope
Somewhere there are dreams
Far from soot and smoke
Let's go surfing, babe
Tonight as we look at the moon and the stars
From our room with security bars
There's a westerly wind that is blowing both our minds
And both our feet
Walk through sand that's as white as the snow
Past the people named Kelley and Joe
Who have nothing in common with anyone we know
We know they're
Too Wagnerian
Too Shakespearian
Too impossible
Let's go surfing, babe
Somewhere there is hope
Far from everything
Far from misanthropes
Let's go surfing, babe
Tonight, from a room only Dickens could love
Wearing moth-eaten sweaters and gloves
We will open the window and feel an on-shore wind
A-blowing in
Grab our boards from the back of our van
Paddle out 'til we can't see the sand
Spin around and drop into the wave we hope will never end
Somewhere there is hope
Somewhere there are dreams
Far from everything
Let's go surfing, babe
Tonight, grab our boards from the back of our van
Paddle out 'til we can't see the sand
Spin around and drop into the wave we hope will never end
Catch a wave, a wave, a wave
Catch a wave, a wave, a wave
Somewhere there is hope
Somewhere there are dreams
Far from everything
Let's go surfing, babe
