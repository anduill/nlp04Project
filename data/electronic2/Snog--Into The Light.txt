In the secret halls they made 
With violence as their trade 
Behind curtain, beyond charade 
In whispers, they say 

Pain, you've seen it all 
You stagger and fall 
But after the fight 
You're into the light 
The deeper you go 
The further you get 
Try as you might 
You're into the light 

The carrot and the stick 
The walls, so thick 
The prison of today 
With malice, they say 

Out of night that covers me 
Black as the pit from pole to pole 
I thank whatever gods may be 
For my unconquerable soul 
In the fell clutch of circumstance 
I have not winced nor cried aloud 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 
My head is bloody but unbowed 
Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
Looms but the horror of the shade 
And yet the menace of the years 
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid 
It matters not how straight the gate 
How charged with punishments the scroll 
I am the master of my fate 
And I am the captain of my soul
