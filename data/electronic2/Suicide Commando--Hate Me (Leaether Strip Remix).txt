Come on and hate me

You slowly kill me
Head to the floor
You don't possess me
I'm not your fucking whore
You say you love me
But you really don't care
You hurt my feelings
Led me to despair

You softly kill me
Dominating my mind
Your soul inflicts me
You can't be that blind
I'm sick and tired of
Just playing this game
I'm not your servant
You drive me insane

Come on and hate me

You're judging people
By the music they make
Don't even know me
You think it's all fake
You're judging people
By the clothes that they wear
Humiliate me
Well I don't fucking care

I want to live my life
The way that I want
Take it or leave it
This is what I want
Don't try to take away 
The rest of my life
Don't try to break me
Cause this is my life

Come on and hate me

You slowly kill me
Head to the floor
You don't possess me
I'm not your fucking whore
You say you love me
But you really don't care
You hurt my feelings
Led me to despair

You softly kill me
Dominating my mind
Your soul inflicts me
You can't be that blind
I'm sick and tired of
Just playing this game
I'm not your servant
You drive me insane

Come on and hate me

Asshole
Dickhole
Fuckhole

Come on and hate me
