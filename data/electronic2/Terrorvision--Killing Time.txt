Maybe someday soon,
I'll find out what it's all about,
And if you don't leave it too long,
Then maybe we'll be able to sort it out.
Give me five minutes more,
I'm not trying to turn you away,
Spend all my time asking you what's wrong,
But all you say is you can't explain.

I hope it'll all come through,
Then I can find it out for myself,
I wish it'd all come true,
And let it sort things out for itself.

Leave me to myself for a while,
It'll only hurt more now if you stay,
I don't know how to break the news,
But maybe we'll be better off this way.

I hope it'll all come through,
Then I can find it out for myself,
I wish it'd all come true,
And let it sort things out for itself
