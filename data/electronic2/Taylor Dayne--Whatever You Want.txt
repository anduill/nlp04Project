Whatever you want me to do
I will it for you
Whatever you want me to be
I will be what you need
Because it's vibes that I feel
Whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
I can't deny in myself
I'm wanting you and no one else
You've got me raptured
Uh huh
'Cause time takes and love heals
Wherever we are I know that it's real
Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be
Yeah, yeah
I will be what you need
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're really near
I'm feeling sensual
But now I know, I know that it's real
Hey hey hey hey
Oh oh oh yeah
I know you've got flames in your heart
That tore you apart
I know you've been safe on your own
Yeah
But together we're strong
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're holding me
I'm feeling passionate
I can't deny in myself
I'm wanting you and no one else
You got the power
Uh huh
Cause love takes and time steals
And deep in my heart
I know that it's real
Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you
Whatever you want me to be
I will be everything
Because it's love that I feel
Whenever you're next to me
I'm feeling sensual
And now I know, I know that it's real
Yeah
Whatever you want me to do
Whatever you want me to do
Oh
Cause time takes and love heals
Wherever we are I know that it's real
I know, I know that it's real
Yeah
Whatever you want me to do
I will it for you
Whatever you want me to be
Yeah
I will be everything
Whatever you want me to do
I will it for you
Whatever you want me to be
What you need
Whatever you want me to do
Baby baby

I'm feeling sensual
