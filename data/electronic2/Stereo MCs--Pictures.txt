I see places I shouldn't have seen
I been places I shouldn't have been
I turn things baby know what I mean
I don't know if I'm man or machine

I see pictures in the back of my mind
I see pictures in the back of my mind
They're just pictures a delicate mixture on the stave on

People fighting in a faraway land
Turf wars on the palm of my hand
Sugar coat it sweeter than honey
You can ride like a crash test dummy

We wait and watch and we watch and we wait
Pushing buttons as we regulate
Playing uptown ginger on the twenty first star and
Smith and Wesson or a bedtime story bout

Pictures in the back of my mind
I see pictures in the back of my mind
They're just pictures, a delicate mixture on the stave on

Don't let me down, don't let me down
Do the right thing bring me around
Don't let me down, don't let me down
Do the right thing bring me around

Breath it in and breath it out
Reaping spaces what it's all about
Killing time when it's an illusion
I guess it helps knowing there's no where out


I see pictures in the back of my mind
I see pictures in the back of my mind
They're just pictures, in the back of my mind
in the back of my mind
in the back of my mind

(In the back of my mind)

I see pictures
I see pictures in my mind

I see pictures
I see pictures in my mind
