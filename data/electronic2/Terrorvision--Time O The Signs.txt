I'm high up on your cross and I'm burning, burning,
I couldn't give a toss I'm just a worm that's turning,
Radical, oh so radical,
Radical, oh so radical.
I'll fight for your cause saying something's a disgrace,
But if the trend changes then so can my face,
That's comical, no now I'm cynical,
That's comical, no now I'm cynical.

Can't go under but it's time to decide,
Time to decide.
Can't go over 'cos its much too high,
Sign of the times.

I'm a martyr to my needs, I'm not a martyr of war,
I'm not looking for sympathy I'm in search of applause,
Well that's typical, oh so typical,
That's typical, oh so typical.

Can't go under but it's time to decide,
Time to decide.
Can't go over 'cos its much too high,
Sign of the times.

I wouldn't say I'm selfish, I'd just say I'm concerned,
Politically motivated, help the flag get burned,
Hey that's topical, I'm very topical,
Hey that's topical, I'm very topical.
Now I sing about love and I sing about castles,
I've forgotten all my past and it's right on hassles,
Hypocritical? No, it wasn't critical,
Hypocritical? No, it wasn't critical.

Can't go under but it's time to decide,
Time to decide.
Can't go over 'cos its much too high,
Sign of the times
