There's no way that I could ever explain
I got to hold you in my arms, dear
Or else go insane
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
It makes me just a little dizzy
And out of control
But I've been waiting all my life
For someone I could stand
And you're the primary reason
I feel like a man
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
I couldn't ever hope to tell you
I'm sure you must know

It ain't the cool thing to be leaving
You're a sweet, young, and naive thing
Here comes the night
There goes my heart
Let's make love and not fall apart

I'm so grateful
For the love that we share
I'll never take it for granted
That you're always there
And when I think about the world
And what is going on
It makes me even more thankful
That you're still around
And I've been waiting all my life
For someone I could stand
And you're the only one so far
Who could understand
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
I couldn't ever hope to tell you
I'm sure you must know

It ain't the cool thing to be leaving
You're a sweet, young, and naive thing
Here comes the night
There goes my heart
Let's make love and not fall apart

When I see you there
With tears in your eyes
And I know somethin's gonna happen
That I might not like
I feel a worry in my heart
A worry in my soul
In fact, it's only you rehearsing
For some silly role
And you say, did I have you fooled
Were you really fooled
And I say, sorry pretty baby
No, I wasn't fooled
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
I couldn't ever hope to tell you
I'm sure you must know

It ain't the cool thing to be leaving
You're a sweet, young, and naive thing
Here comes the night
There goes my heart
Let's make love and not fall apart
