And now it seems
As if we're used to the chagrin
We made our beds
And now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this red sea
I'm a shackled child
Singing the good song of freedom
They've got no pride
They interrupt our grieving
Tear drops dropping
For the pain of the world
My best friend dies
When she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves
We just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hanging
Will you tie up the rope and shout pull
Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing
How many years
Before we practice what we preach
How many tears
Before we truly clinch the peak
Only to find that
There is no honey on the moon
Official goon
With the unofficial croon

[2x]
I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I’ll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

16 bar cycles
Heart felt recital
From the wacky blacky man
They should have called me Michael
Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
Cause it's each to his self
In these times that we live
Does god have a sense of humor
Then the joke's on us
Cause we're chasing our tails
For how long
The tussle makes us how strong
Vintage poor people fun
If we could ease up
On these booze and fags
Then, just maybe
Life wouldn't seem so mad
Be a man my dad said
But what the hell he know
He lost his dreams
He lost his flow
And I don't wanna be alone
I'm born king
So where's my throne
I'm too intense
I'm too deep
I'm too nice for life
So what makes this place so nervous?

[4x]
I'm all things to all men
All of the women
All the children
Just say when
And I’ll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest
Who's the hardest

Look at the monster you make
Look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
But you claim not
We're searching for Jesus
But I’ll be damned
If I’ll be crucified by ten thousand spies
Compulsive lies
They hate me
They love me
They hate me

Cause I’m all things to all men, all of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my Tardis
Who's the hardest, who's the hardest
