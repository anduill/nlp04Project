I'm so tired of your lies 
you will never know the truth 
I'm so tired of your words 
you better shut your mouth 
I can't stand the way you dress 
everything looks so funny on you 
I can't stand your fucking clich√© 
but it's all you have 

I don't believe that you can ever be 
never be like me 
you better try to find the way I feel 
you will never be like me 

you think you can take me as your idol 
you try to copy me 
but you're not worth to know my name 
you're one of a million assholes 
you can never leave your world 
you are to weak to fight 
you'll ever be this piece of shit 
it stinks when you're around
