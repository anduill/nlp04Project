I could see the other end 
Repeat as necessary 
A beam shown divided 
Shaded over screens 
In the presence of visuals 
Covered and drawn in 
Watched its repetition siphoning 

In the corners 
Locusts rotating 
Empty me feeding 

Conceived the believing 
As parted or programmed 
Plans of obsolescence 
Inhale again 
Do you see its face? 
Or the master's orders 
They consumed the maker over again 

In the corners 
Locusts rotating 
Empty me feeding
