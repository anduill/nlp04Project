you go to bed like every night
but there is fear inside your mind
you are afraid to close your eyes
inside your body your small heart cries
he says girl my love is true
don't tell your mom things we do
but you can't stand it anymore
it is to late he opens the door
he's coming for you

Someone - comes to you at night
Someone - watches you while you sleep
Someone - says baby, please don't cry
Someone - wants to fuck you like a whore
Someone - he's your nightmare

you see a shadow on the wall
he kicks away your little doll
your hear his soft and friendly voice
he says, baby don't make a noise
but tonight you change your life
in your hand you feel the knife
you feel the knife
