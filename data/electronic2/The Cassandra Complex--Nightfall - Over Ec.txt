When I hear you calling I won't answer
When I hear you calling I won't be there
I'll be flying over some other Europe
Filled with darkness, filled with despair

Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls over Western Europe

Jihad is coming, jihad is coming
The Third World War is coming home

Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls over Western Europe

The hills are alive with the sound of gunfire
Kill them all, God will know his own
And night falls over Western Europe
Night falls, and we're alone

Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls over Western Europe
Night falls
