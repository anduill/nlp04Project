Starts off early Monday, the beginning of the week,
With a belly full of serpents wriggling round making me feel sick,
Well I know I went out last night, and it's the price I'll have to pay,
But before I've even found my feet I've been discovered by Tuesday.
Green is the colour of your eyes,
Grey is the colour of your skin,
Yellow is the colour of your tongue, tongue, tongue,
If I was you, well I'm not am I?

Well I know I'm not you, you're not me,
But everybody join in after three,
One, two, three.

Green is the colour of your eyes,
Grey is the colour of your skin,
Yellow is the colour of your tongue, tongue, tongue,
If I was you, well I'm not am I?

Green is the colour of your eyes,
Grey is the colour of your skin,
Yellow is the colour of your tongue, tongue, tongue,
If I was you, well I'm not am I?

If I'm not you, who the hell am I
