from the lines you read
they have you believe
that there is a way
through the escapade
breathe like you never before
and you take what you know
when its all said and gone
they said to me
your road is paved
the imagery
is sold and played
and when the tide turns
and a soul resists
and when you feel burned
you move ahead
your parody
plays in part
and all through the start
cutting strips out of air
your driver impaired
breathe like you never before
and you take what you know
when its all said and gone
they said to me
your road is paved
the imagery
is sold and played
and when the tide turns
and a soul resists
and when it feels burned
you move ahead
breathe like never before
from the line you read
they have you believe
that there is a way
through the escapade
they said to me
your road is paved
the imagery
is sold and played
and when the tide turns
and a soul resists
and when it feels burned
you move ahead
you move ahead
