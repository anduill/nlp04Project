Welcome into my world
Welcome into my world

Welcome into my house
Come along and follow me
To a place that you've never been
A mystic fantasy

Take a ride and go with me
In a time and a space
I'll show you things that you never knew
Existed in another place

Ah aah, I wanna know
Ah aah, I wanna know
Are you ready, are you ready
You ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready
You ready, are you ready?

Welcome to tomorrow

Welcome to tomorrow

Welcome into my house
Come along and follow me
To a place that you've never been
A mystic fantasy

Take a ride and go with me
In a time and a space
I'll show you things that you never knew
Existed in another place

Hokus pockus, turn around
Ain't no magic act around
Hokus pockus, turn around
Ain't no magic act around

Hokus pockus, turn around
Ain't no magic act around
Hokus pockus, turn around
Ain't no magic act around

Welcome into my world
