Every night I wake in my bed
I hear how life beats in my head
You are so near in my sweetest dream
You are my prince You are my prince

In the darkest coldest night
I hear Your whisper please don't cry
I feel Your warm embrace
Your warm embrace
When Your shadow is passing by
I hear Your voice oh please be mine
You are my prince
My prince of the darkness

I lived my life without seeing sun
with broken soul with broken heart
I don't want to suffer anymore
Without You without You

In the darkest coldest night
I hear Your whisper please don't cry
I feel Your warm embrace
Your warm embrace
When Your shadow is passing by
I hear Your voice oh please be mine
You are my prince
My prince of the darkness
