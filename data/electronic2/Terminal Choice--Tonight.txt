I see darkness around me
Where ever I go
The trees are dying
I want you to know
Empty spaces in the silence of the night
A cold wind is blowing
Hurts me inside
Everywhere people are crying
Especially tonight
I can hear them shouting
Words of fright
But I can never help them
I`m kind of paralyzed
Can´t you see I am dying?
Would you help me tonight?

Never thought that I would ever see hell
But now it´s time for me
I can hear the command
I´m waiting for you
It´s cold outside
But you can´t move
You´re kind of paralyzed
