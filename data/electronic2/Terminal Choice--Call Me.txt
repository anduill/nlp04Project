call me call me what you like
I'm nobody
tell me tell me what you think
I'm you fool
call me call me what you like
I'm no body, I don't care about what you say

you can call me crazy
you can call me shithead
you can try to change me
but you have no chance

you're so fucking boring
and you think I'm a fool
you think you are better
that your buff and cool

I don't want to follow
I don't want to obey
I can't stand your lies
and I know how to break you

chorus:
(you can't you can't)
you can't ever break us
(break us, break us)
you can't ever hold us down
(you can't you can't)
this world belongs to us
(break us break us)
and we are not the ones to blame

we will start the fire
we will make you burn
and we will not give in
cause we will fuck you up

you're so fucking boring
and you think I'm a fool
you think you are better
that your buff and cool

chorus

call me call me what you like
I'm nobody
tell me tell me what you think
I'm you fool
call me call me what you like
I'm no body, I don't care about what you say
