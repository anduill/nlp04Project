darkness falls through
the trees in the forest
it's the forest of sadness
no light will ever shine here

everlasting silence
nothing is here
loneliness is your best friend
here in the forest of fear

you feel something creeping
out of the earth
coldness and fear
reaching your soul

unholy laughter
hurts in your ears
the breath of death
captures your heart

a rotten hand reaches
for your skin
pale eyes from hell
paralyse your thoughts

he take you away
deep into the forest
he absorbs your life
you have never existed here...

my rotten hand reaches
for your skin
pale eyes from hell
paralyse your thoughts

i take you away
deep into my forest
i am absorbs your life
you have never existed here
