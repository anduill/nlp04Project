Where were you, God?
As they ran amok...
Bloody gunshot crime
Death at Columbine

Where were you, God ?
As they ran amok...
To hell with Jesus Christ
Death needs no compromise

They came to kill
They came to thrill
They came to burn
They came to yearn...

They were playing God
Phantoms of amok

They came to kill
They came to thrill
They came to burn
They came to yearn...
For a place in hell
