Must keep my composure
Must keep my composure

Spank Rock and the killers
(Round 1... FIGHT!)

Moving through the city, fill my body with the poison
Head spinning, caught a rhythm like clockwork
I ain’t trying to do no wrong but they leave with no choice man
There is so much spirit cut the curse to my verse

Peter Piper pick peppers and I snort lines
Sorry mom I'm just a man of my times
And even though they hold me hostage
Said I ain’t worth a dime and time is money, huh, I ain’t worth your time

And I ain’t worth your time
But I ain’t worth your time
But I ain’t worth your time
Hold it down

Must keep my composure
Must keep my composure

Must keep my composure
Through your controller
London, hold me closer
Until this is over

Spank Rock and the killers
(Round 2... FIGHT!)

Everybody is quick to put their arms around me
They got nuttin' to lose – all this gain, shit, I'm empty inside
And every time I try to refuel, quickly draining
Told me times are hard, thought I would be fine but

What? These pricks spit upon the sentiment fiercely
Up against it without seeking the intent of it
You don't know me and you don't know my style
Kid, I'm a marathon – your thoughts a quarter mile

Said you don't know my style
You ain’t half this wild
You ain’t half this wild
Hold it down

That’s right let’s stay groove
Come on and let me see you move
That’s right let’s stay groove
Come on and let me see you WOO

Hands up
Hands up
Stand up
Stand up, WOO

Takin' it back to the basics, face it
We are the kind to pitch this song in basement
And I ain’t tying to have a problem here
So put your ego in check and get that ass in gear
