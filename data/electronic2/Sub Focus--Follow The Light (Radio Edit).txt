Beautiful
mystery
just a dream

don't turn 'round
push them up
trust in me

follow the light



Beautiful
mystery
just a dream

don't turn 'round
push them up
trust in me



I'm just a dreamer
you are just a dream
and when I'm sleepless
you all come to me
follow
follow
follow the light



Beautiful
mystery
just a dream

don't turn 'round
push them up
trust in me
