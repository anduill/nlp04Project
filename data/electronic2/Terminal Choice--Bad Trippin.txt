You don't have a Job but that's no problem,
I can help you out
You got no money but that's no problem, 
I can help you out

You got no girlfriend, you got no sex
You have nothing, that's worth living for
You got no friends, you got no religion
But i can show you something to believe in

4x:
Take me, use me and enjoy
Take me, use me, you're my toy 

2x:
I am here to make you happy
I show you my secret treat
I take all the bad dreams away 
Why don't you lay back and enjoy this trip?

You lose you conscience but that's ok
I can help you out
You lose control, but that's ok
I can help you out

Open your mind and open your soul
You just have to let me in
I prevent that you realize
That's a game that you can't win

2x:
I am here to make you happy
I show you my secret treat
I take all the bad dreams away 
Why don't you lay back and enjoy this trip?

2x:
Take me, use me and enjoy
Take me, use me, you're my toy 

2x:
I am here to make you happy
I show you my secret treat
I take all the bad dreams away 
Why don't you lay back and enjoy this trip
