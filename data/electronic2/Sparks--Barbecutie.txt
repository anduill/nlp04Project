For the sake of man he has forsaken his whole tan
Living in the snow advancing how much we will know
But his heart cries out

Barbecutie, Barbecutie, Barbecutie, you Barbecutie,
when you're with him he is warm

Let's pursue this more why should he leave so much that's warm
To his detriment maybe he's oh so slightly bent
Ask her, she would know

Barbecutie...

The friends are getting friendly on the lawn
the flies are making enemies of all
Aroma rising from the ancient coals
has turned you into someone very bold
and killed whatever hesitance she showed

Barbecutie...

Look he's back unharmed he must defrost his frozen charm
"How are you today" that's very good, he's on his way
To the Barbecue

Barbecutie..
