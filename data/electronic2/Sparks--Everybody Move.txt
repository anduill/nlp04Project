Everybody move
Move it on up and move it down
Sweet little thing ease it down
Fall in the pool and you'll drown
Everybody move

Wear out the soles of your shoes
Wear out the soles of your feet
Move to the beat, toute de suite
There's a red light a comin'
There's a red light a comin'
Slam on the brakes and slow down
Everybody move

Unwanted pounds will disappear
You'll have an itty-bitty rear
Better lay off of the beer
There's a new thang a comin'
There's a new thang a comin'
Better do something with your hair
