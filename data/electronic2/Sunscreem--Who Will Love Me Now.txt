In the forest there's a monster
It has done terrible things
So in the world it's hiding
And this is the song it sings

Who will live me now?
Who will ever love me?
Who will say to me?
You are my desire?
I'll set you free?

Who will live me now?
Who will ever love me?
Who will say to me?
You are my desire?
I'll set you free?
