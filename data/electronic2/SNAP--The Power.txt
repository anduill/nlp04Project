Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I've got the power hey yeah heh
I've got the power
I've got the power
Oh-oh-oh

Like the crack of the whip I snap attack
Front to back in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel rhyme devil
On a heavenly level
Bang the bass turn up the treble
Radical mind day and night all the time
Seven to fourteen wise divine
Maniac brainiac winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah
I've got the power
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh yeah
Say Loud!
I've got the power

Quality I possess something I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the rest
Of the microphone that I am holdin'

If they are snap
Don't need the police to try to save them
Your voice will sink so please stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that

It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's gettin' it's gettin' it's gettin' kinda hectic

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
I've got the power
Yeah! Yeah!
I've got the power
