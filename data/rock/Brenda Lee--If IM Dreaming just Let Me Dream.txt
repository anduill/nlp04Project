Please don't tell me if you're not real let me keep feeling the way I feel
I'm bubblin' over with love supreme and if I'm dreaming just let me dream
Ah please don't wake me if I'm asleep just give the angels my soul to keep
I'd be so happy if I could speak and if I'm dreaming just let me dream
My heart is jumpin' up and down the street if this ain't love it's the next best thing
So keep on doing what your doing to me if I'm your prisoner don't set me free
Your red hot kisses warm me like steam cause so if I'm dreaming just let me dream
[ sax ]
So keep on doing...
Just let me dream
