Life is like a merry go round painted horses riding up and down
Music takes you and you're gone again
Crazy circles never seem to end

Oh I will face the sun
Leavin shadows for behind
And together we'll go on
Through time oh yeah

Life is like a game of chance
Some find riches and some romance
Some find happiness and some find sorrow
Some find it today and some maybe tomorrow

Oh I will face the sun
Leavin shadows for behind
And together we'll go on
Through time oh yeah

Life is like a carousel you aim for heaven
And you wind up in hell
To all the world you're livin like a king
But you're just a puppet on a broken string

Oh I will face the sun
Leavin shadows for behind
And together we'll go on
Through time oh yeah

Life is like mm and the life is like mm
Crazy circles goin round and round
Crazy circles round and round and
One day you're up and the next day you're down
Life is like a merry go round
