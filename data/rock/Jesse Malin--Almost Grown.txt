My parents split up in the first grade
My father never did come back
My sister liked John Travolta
But I wanted Billy Jack

Throwing things off of the rooftops
40 buildings all the same
My mother took a job as a waitress
Swimming in the divorce age

When you're all alone
And you're all alone
When you're all alone and you're almost grown

Me and Holly snuck into night clubs
The politics of punk rock church
We were so idealistic
But somehow only saw the worst

When you're young and violent sick and silent
Hoping just to be admired
Water seeks its level of pain
And you're all alone
And you're all alone
And you're all alone
And you're almost grown

Some old friends retired too
But they still laugh about me and you

My mother's ashes went into the ocean
Scattered on a windy day
She used to like Frank Sinatra
Cigarettes and JFK

Some retired some expired some were meant
To be admired for a moment at a young age
But I don't care what they say others went and got away
I just want to see her again

When you're all alone
When you're all alone
When you're all alone
You're almost grown
When you're all alone and your heart is stone
