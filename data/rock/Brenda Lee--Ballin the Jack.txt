Ballin' The Jack
First you put your two knees close up tight
Then you sway them to the left and then you sway them to the right
Step around the floor kind-a nice and light
Then you twist around twist around with all of your might
Put your loving arms straight out in space
Do the eagle rock with style and grace
Swing your foot way around and bring it back
Now that's what I call balling the jack
