we were above
you standing underneath us
we were not yet lovers
dragons were smoked 
bumblebees were stinging us
I was soon to be crazy

eat, drink and be merry 
for tomorrow we die
'cause we're tripping Billies

we're wearing nothing 
nothing but out shadows 
shadows falling down on the beach sand
remembering once, 
out on the beaches we wore 
pineapple grass bracelets

so why would you care 
to get out of this place
you and me and all our friends
such a happy human race
'cause we're tripping Billies

we are all sitting 
legs crossed round a fire
my yellow flame she dances
tequila drinking oh our 
minds will wonder 
to wondrous places

so why would you care 
to get out of this place
you and me and all our friends
such a happy human race

eat, drink and be merry 
for tomorrow we die
