It's all too clear now
Well, I been runnin' away
Almost on the hour
Of mostly every day

Now I see colors
That I never seen
And now the reddest of them all
So vibrant out of me

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

See this zero
The lowest of the low
I let you take me down
Until lower, I could not go

Now I see scars
I willingly made
I facilitated one need
Now here I lay

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

Tell me what was I
What was I thinkin'?
Tell me what was I
What was I thinkin'?

Tell me what was I
What was I thinkin'?
Tell me what was I
What the hell was I thinkin'?

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be
