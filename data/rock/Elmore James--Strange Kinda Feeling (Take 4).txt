Gotta strange kinda feelin' my baby don't love me no more
Gotta strange kinda feelin' my baby don't love me no more
I lost my baby when she walked out the door
Tell me baby, please tell me
Tell me baby, please tell me
Tell me baby why can't we agree
My baby left me, left me all alone
My baby left me, left me all alone
I hope some day she will come back home
I love my baby, I'll tell the world I do
I love my baby, I'll tell the world I do
Just seein' my baby, makes my dreams come true
