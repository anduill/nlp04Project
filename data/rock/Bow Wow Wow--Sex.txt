Cuff your chick

It won't take long for you to get it up
I got that long stroke I go deep enough
So come here shawty let me lay you down
and let me show you what I'm all about
Bring your camera we gon' have some fun
and she know Bow got that tornado tongue
I dont think that you can handle it
Shawty can you drive a stick
Drive me outta this world man
Super bad and damn she thick

Do he sex you like this
Do he sex you like that (x4)

Come on lets make love what you trippin' bout
Now don't be scared once I whip it out
She give me head til' I pass out
Pullin on her head tryin not to pull her track out
I know you want it from the back
I know you like it like that
Bitin all over while she scratchin on my back

Do he sex you like this
Do he sex you like that (x4)

Oh Turn off the lights, the lights, the lights
tu-turn off the lights, the lights, the lights (x3)

Do he sex you like this
Do he sex you like that(x4)

I'm saying, any time you need a nigga
you just pick up the phone and call,
there's no problem cause I...
/and this that baby makin music

Do he sex you like this (let's go)
Do he sex you like that (that's right)
