Hear that cry throughout the streets, we know just what it means
And even to the ignorant, it ain't what it seems
Through every shitty backstreet, the kids are all around
They all come and join the firm, cause they know that sound
They all try to ignore us, but we won't let 'em win
The wankers try to put us down, but we will smash them in 
Cause we all say, that they're full of shit

I'm running down the back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
I'm running and I'm free
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Cause we all know that's the sound of the streets

I'm running down a back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Dr martens on our feet
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And you're all running down a back street with me

The kids they come from everywhere, the east endâ€™s all around
Cause they all know just what it means, when they hear the sound
So you know what to do, when you hear the call
Put your boots and arrys on, and kick down that fucking wall
You can listen to politicians, they'll lead you astray
You've gotta see the light and you've gotta see the way
And we all know that there's nothing like us

I'm running down the back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And we're never giving in
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Cause we all know that we're gonna fucking win

I'm running down the back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And we're here to stay
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And we all know that we're gonna win anyway

They all try to ignore us, but we won't let 'em win
The wankers try to put us down, but we will smash them in 
Cause we all say, that they're full of shit

I'm running down the back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
I'm running and I'm free
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Cause we all know that's the sound of the streets

I'm running down a back street
Oi! Oi! Oi!
Dr martens on our feet
Oi! Oi! Oi!
And you're all running down a back street with me, with me
