Dance to the beat of the livin dead
Lose sleep baby and stay away from bed
Raw power is sho' to come a runnin to you
If you're alone and you got the fear
So am I baby let's move on out of here
Raw power will surely come a runnin to you
Raw power got a magic touch
Raw power is much too much
Happiness is a guaranteed
It was made for you and me
Raw power honey just won't quit
Raw power I can feeeeeel it
Raw power baby can't be beat
Poppin eyes and flashin feet
Don't you try
Don 't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody's always tryin to tell me what to do

Look in the eyes of a savage girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come a runnin to you 
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I baby and I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come a runnin to you
Raw power got a healin hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power it's a more than soul
Got a son called rock and roll
Raw power honey just won't quit
Raw power I can feel it
Raw power honey can't be beat
Get down, baby and a kiss my feet
Everybody's always tryin to tell me what to do
Don't you try
Don 't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody's always tryin to tell me what to do
Don't you try
Don 't you try to tell me what to do

Raw power's got no place to go
Raw power honey it don't want to know
Raw power is a guaranteed o.d.
Raw power is laughin at you and me

And this is what I wanna know
Can you feeeeeel it
Can you feeeeeeeeel it
Can you feeeeeel it
Can you feeeeeeeeeeeel it
Raw power! raw powwwwwwer!
Raw power! raw powwwwwwwwer!
Can you feeeeeeeeeeeel it
