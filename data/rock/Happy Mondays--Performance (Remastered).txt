One day he was admiring his reflection
in his favorite mirror
When he realised all too clearly
what a freakin' old beasty man he was
Who is? you is, you is now son

I took to hiding, I took to hiding
I took to hiding, hiding strange things
I took to dribbling, we took to dribbing down my front
I starting running, I starting running on the spot 

Picture, picture, now i'm gonna eat your
Picture, picture, now i'm gonna eat ya

We're all food, your cake
We're all the food, your weirdos' cream

Quick quick, fast fast, quick quick, fast fast
I took to dribbling, I took to dribbing down my front
You took to hiding, you took to hiding strange things

One day she was touching her reflection
in her favorite mirror
when she relised all to clearly 
what a freakin' old weirdo she was
Who was? She was, she is...

fast fast, quick quick, quick quick, fast fast
She took to hiding, she took to hiding strange things 
I took to dribbling, I took to dribbing down my front
