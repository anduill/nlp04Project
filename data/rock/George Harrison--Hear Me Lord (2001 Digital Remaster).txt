Forgive me lord
Please, those years when I ignored you, hmm
Forgive them lord
Those that feel they can't afford you, hmm

Help me lord, please
To rise above this dealing, hmm
Help me lord, please
To love you with more feeling, hmm

At both ends of the road
To the left and the right
Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me lord

(Hear me lord)
(Hear me lord)
(Hear me lord)
(Hear me lord)

At both ends of the road

Above and below us
Out and in, there's no place that you're not in
Oh, won't you hear me lord

Help me lord, please
To rise a little higher, hmm
Help me lord, please
To burn out this desire, hmm

Hear me lord, please
Hear me lord, please

Oh, won't you please, please
Hear me lord
Oh, hear me lord
Hear me lord

Oh, won't you please, please

Won't you please / (Hear me lord)
Oh, hear me lord, hear me lord
