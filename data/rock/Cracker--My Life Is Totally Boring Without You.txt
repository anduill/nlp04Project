My life is totally boring without you around
These days, they fade to another
I want you around
So I'd like to say
That I'm better off
I'm happier this way

But my life is totally empty without you around
Well my life is totally boring without you

Well I fell, but you fell much farther
I was envious
Around here, everyone loves you
Cause you are insane
So we started a band
Owe it all to our fans
Went somewhere near the top

My life is totally empty without you around
Yeah my life is totally boring without you

My life is totally boring without you around
These days, they fade to another
I want you around
So I'd like to say
That I'm better off
I'm happier this way

My life is totally empty without you around
Yeah my life is totally boring without you around

My life is totally empty without you around
Yeah my life is totally boring without you
