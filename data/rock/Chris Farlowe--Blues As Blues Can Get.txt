Gonna sit right down in my easy chair
Pull out a deck of cards, play some solitaire
Break out a bottle, wash me a glass
To keep me company 'til the feelings pass
Everybody needs someting to do
Me, I'll just sit here and think about you
It might seem hopeless, but it ain't that bad yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...

I need to call somebody, someone I can trust
I need the number for lovers' anonymous
I'll tell 'em my story, hope they understand
Maybe they can explain it to me
'cause I don't think I can
I'll take your picture down from my wall
Try to remember the thrill of it all
I know it's over, but it ain't over yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...

Why fight the feeling when I can't fight back the tears
I stare at the ceiling and wish that you were here
I'm going crazy, but I ain't crazy yet
It's just the blues as blues can get...
