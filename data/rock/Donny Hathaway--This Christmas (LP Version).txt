Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better, this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together, this Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you, this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town they do this Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me, yeah

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me, yeah

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better, this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together, this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me

Merry Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Wish your brother Merry Christmas
All over the land now, yeah

Merry Christmas
