it's 1969 ok all across the usa 
It's another year for me and you 
Another year with nothing to do 
Last year I was 21 I didn't have a lot of fun 
And now I'm gonna be 22 I say oh my and a boo-hoo 
It's 1969 ok all across the usa 
It's enother year for me and you 
Another year with nothing to do 
Another year with nothing to do 
It's 1969 
1969 1969 1969 1969 baby 
And it's 1969 bayyyyyyybee 
Baby 
Baby 
Baby
