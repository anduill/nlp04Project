Oh my love, oh my love
I can't hear you my love
Tell me where have you gone?

Oh my love, oh my love
I can't taste you my love,
Tell me what have I done?

Plug it in, so I can digest you
I will taste you

Far away, far away
I can't feel you today
I need healing my love

Appetite running fast
Following my gut
Turning up every rock

You're disappearing my love,
I need louder than this
Please fill me up 

Goof tidings I bring
To you and your sins
I'll forgive

Come to me
Plug it in, so I can digest you
I will taste you (Ooh ooh)
My appetite in that hole
Tempt you with it now
I will taste you (Ooh ooh)

Please shake me and tug,
I need shaking my love
Can't you be the one?

I can't fake it my love,
I need filling come on,
I need it louder than bombs

Come to me
Plug it in, so I can digest you
I will taste you (Ooh ooh)
My appetite in that hole
Tempt you with it now
I will taste you (Ooh ooh)

Feel that movement my love?
Pulling up from above
Are you listening love?

My emptiness in a way,
Is tempting,
Guiding you from my gut
{I will taste you, I've got a big mouth, Oh my love
