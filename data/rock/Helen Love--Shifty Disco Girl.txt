Wants to be his one and only
Sheena's in love with Joey Ramoney

Joey Ramoney, whenever you're lonely
All you got to do is call me,
There's a girl who loves you on the other side of the world

Sheena's in love with Joey Ramoney,
Sheena's in love with Joey Ramoney

He's seven foot tall, arms down to the floor,
In his ripped-up jeans he's making me scream,
Oh Joey, Joey Ramoney

He's got long black hair, he jumps in the air,
When he counts up to four it's like a nuclear war,
Oh Joey, Joey Ramoney

Do you remember when
you heard him sing on the radio
Joey Ramoney
Don't he look good?
Joey Ramoney
Don't he look good?
Joey Ramoney
Don't he look good?
Joey Ramoney

Sheena's in love with Joey Ramoney,
Wants to be his one and only,

Joey Ramoney, whenever you're lonely,
All you got to do is call me
There's a girl who loves you on the other side of the world

Hey ho, let's go,
Hey ho, let's go,
