This fucking city 
Is run by pigs 
They take the rights away 
From all the kids 

Understand 
We're fighting a war we can't win 
They hate us-we hate them 
We can't win-no way 

Walk down the street 
I flip them off 
They hit me across the head 
With a billy club 

Understand 
We're fighting a war 
We can't win 
They hate us-we hate them 
We can't win-no way 

Nothing I do, nothing I say 
I tell them to go get fucked 
They put me away 

Understand 
We're fighting a war 
We can't win 
They hate us-we hate them 
We can't win-no way 

I go to court, 
For my crime, 
Stand in line pay bail, 
I may serve time 
Understand 
We're fighting a war 
We can't win 
They hate us-we hate them 
We can't win-no way
