Close your eyes and shield your ears. 
Shut your mouth and conceal all your fears. 
Greed it's not going anywhere. 
They should put that on a billboard in Times Square
It could say "The great depression is over my friends." 
What we want and what we need engineered. 
I can smell the bullshit right from here. 
Because greed it's not going anywhere. 
They should put that on a billboard in Times Square
It could say "The great depression is over my friends." 
Blinding your eyes, burning your ears. 
T.V. images are selling. 
Through the static on the radio you can't hear. 
One pill if you're too big (Your ass is too big). 
One pill if you're too small (your dick is too small). 
On one your life is a mess. 
On one you're nothing at all. 
I hate a song that makes you think you are no good. 

I hate a song that makes you think you are just born to lose. 
Bound to lose. 
No good to nobody. 
Too young or too fat or too this or too that.
