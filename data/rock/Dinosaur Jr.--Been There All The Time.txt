Can I fix it and still care
Can I run and you'll be there
Wishin' I could run and hide
Juggling messages inside
Stallin' tring to buy more time
Can I be apart of you
How to get there what to do
Can I get there from inside
All the ways I could of tried

Can I be there all the time
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me

Can I feel another way
Can I bring it out to stay
Can you capture what I've done
Play it back so I don't run
Now i'm walking on your sun
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me

Let's not lie
Take me fie
With a smile
Been there all the time

Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me
Is it all me
