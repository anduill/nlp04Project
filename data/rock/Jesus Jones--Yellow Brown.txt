There is a line between good and evil
That separates light from dark
But a color now spells our end
Everywhere I see its mark
It's yellow brown

In the city air, in all our seas
You see every other color bleed into
Yellow brown

There is no time to spend
Concerned that this is just a trend
To lay the blame everywhere
When it's yours that is the lion's share of
Yellow brown

And I won't do, 'cos you won't do
'Cos we know there's nothing they will do about
Yellow brown

There's nothing to save us from ourselves
But the world keeps turnin'
The world keeps turnin'
Yellow brown
