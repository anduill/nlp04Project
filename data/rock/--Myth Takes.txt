It only takes a little bit of glamour glimmer
only just a little bit of shake-or-shiver
nothing never matters 'til it's shattered
spluttered and covered splattered all over my ???

sha, sha, sha sha sha-doobie
sometimes it's really just like the movies

was a glimpse a little bit of nothing make a difference
and nothing's been the same since the chain of events
it's the place where dreams come true
dreams can still be nightmares too

and ah sha, sha, sha sha whoa whoa
so much it's close enough for rock 'n roll

shoulda told me the world? was gonna tie me back a sweater
poets from the days of old have never said it better
sometimes it really glitters and sometimes it's even gold
baby when it isn't then it must be rock 'n roll

and ah sha, sha, sha sha sha-doobie
sometimes it's really just like the movies

sha, sha, sha sha sha-doobie
sometimes you just stay home and watch movies
