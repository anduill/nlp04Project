Standing by the old car
Sunset in your grey eyes
Listening to the bluebirds
Praying for a sunrise
Maybe we'll make music in dreamland tonight

Someone in the garden
Walking through the moonlight
Sailing in the silence
Hoping for an insight
I know we'll make music in dreamland tonight
Maybe we'll go waltzing in dreamland tonight

I have some pictures
(You have some pictures)
I paint them in my sleep
They make me laugh
(They make me laugh)
Sometimes they make me weep
You are in my pictures too
Portraits of the moon in silver and blue

Ringing in the changes
Chiming like a church bell
Laughing in the mirror
Phantoms of the hotel
Oh well we'll make music in dreamland tonight

Driving like a madman
Trying to make a fast time
Theatre full of strangers
Waiting for a new rhyme
No crime to make music in dreamland tonight
It's time to make music in dreamland tonight
You're mine and my music's in dreamland tonight
