I want to be just everything
More than you need
I want to hear you call
Nothing but me

I'd be lost on my own
A bird on the wings
Heaven knows like a bird
I see everything

Don't want to know
Don't want to know

I want to play on night to night
The world on a string
You look at me
And I wonder what goes on

All that money could buy
And all of those things
I could never be sure
Where to begin

Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Don't want to know

Friday night in the rain
Somebody new
Better now, baby, never
Take it from me

I got nothing but no
So many times
Hold it out to me now
Broken in two

Don't want to know
Don't want to know
Don't want to know
