When the rain came down
In this northern town
It was a banner year
In the world of fear
I thought I’d drop you a line

When you comb your hair
And you’re unaware
And your friends all say that you’re looking great
Those black and white movies apply

Since You’re in Love
I’m still sad over you

Gonna sleep away
All my sunny days
And in another year well I won’t be here
Hoping that you’ll change your mind
Since You’re in Love
I’m still sad over you
