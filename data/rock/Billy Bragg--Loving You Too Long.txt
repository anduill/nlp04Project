Love is a fire that burns,
Love is a wheel that turns,
Love is a thunderstorm
With rain to wash us dry.

Love is the leaf at the top of the tree,
Once love was you and me,
Once love rained down 
In a thunderstorm of passion.

All these things I see,
Are haunting me.

I've been loving you, for too long.
I've been loving you, for too long.

Love is the game she plays,
Love is the good old days,
Love is a shooting star that burns
So bright on that special night.

And love is the promised land,
Love has slipped through my hands,
Love has disappeared
Like a rocket into the ocean.

All these things I see,
Are haunting me.

I've been loving you, for too long.
I've been loving you, for too long.
I've been loving you, for too long.
I've been loving you, for too long.
