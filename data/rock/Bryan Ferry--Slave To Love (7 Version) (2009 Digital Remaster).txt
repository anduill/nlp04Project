Tell her I'll be waiting in the usual place 
With the tired and weary and there's no escape. 
To need a woman you've got to know 
How the strong get weak and the rich get poor. 
Slave to love 
Slave to love. 

You're running with me 
Don't touch the ground. 
We're the restless hearted 
Not the chained and bound. 
The sky is burning 
A sea of flame 

Though your world is changing I will be the same. 
Slave to love 
Slave to love. 

Slave to love 
Slave to love 

No 
I can't escape 
I'm a slave to love. 

The storm is breaking or so it seems 

We're too young to reason to grown up to dream. 
Now spring is turning your face to mine 

I can hear your laughter 
I can see your smile. 

Slave to love 
Slave to love 
. . . 
Slave to love 
Slave to love 
. . . 
Slave to love 
No 
I can't escape 
I'm a slave to love. 
Siave to love. no. I can't escape. I'm a slave to love.
