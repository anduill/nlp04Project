The world is cold tonight
But everything will be alright
She walks into the room
Stars to know her light

[Chorus:]
When she dances
I see where my only chance is
I feel my whole life start, babe
When she loves me
You know she really loves me
She takes it to the heart

The club is closing down
But will we still hang around
To hear another tune
And feel this love we found

[Chorus]

The night's so fine
The rose is mine

She's dancing just for me
I see with every move she makes
How good it's gonna be

[Chorus]

She takes it to the heart
