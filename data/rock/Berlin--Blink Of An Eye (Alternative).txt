I believe in the one love nation
I believe in the human integration
I believe that there's magic up our sleeves
And now it's time to spread it around

I believe in the good vibration
I believe there should be no segregation
I believe that there's magic up our sleeves
And now it's time to spread it around

'Round and 'round and 'round and around and around
We gotta spread it
Around and 'round and 'round and around and around

'Cause in the blink of an eye, you can turn off your mind
In the beat of a drum, you can dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time, in the morning time

I believe in the Y generation
I believe in the age of innovation
I believe there's a cure for the disease
And now we gotta spread it around

I believe that we're God's creation
I believe in loving fornication
I believe that there's magic up our sleeves
And now it's time to spread it around

'Round and 'round and around and around and around
We gotta spread it
Around and 'round and 'round and around and around

'Cause in the blink of an eye, you can turn off your mind
In the beat of a drum, you can dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time, in the morning time

I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe

'Cause in the blink of an eye, you can turn off your mind
In the beat of a drum, you can dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time

In the blink of an eye, you can turn off your mind
In the beat of a drum, you can dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time

In the blink of an eye, you can turn off your mind
In the beat of a drum, you can dance to the sun
And the world is alive, let tomorrow decide
In the morning time

I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
