Like a madman I'm up in the morning,
headin' for the walls of heartache.
Working everyday, bringing home a/the pail of heartbreak.

You look down and the walls are higher*
They are built from the tears you're cryin.
Oh, I got to bring it back,
I'm workin' til the day I'm dyin (oh, yeah!)


Breakin' down the walls of heartache, baby
I'm a carpenter of love and affection!
Breaking down the walls of heartache, baby
Got to tear down all the loneliness and tears
and build you up a house of love.


Yeah!
Breakin' down the walls of heartache, baby
Shakin' down the walls of heartache!
Shakin' down the walls of heartache!


Brick by brick, I'm tearin' them down!
Yeah, lonely night, my name is given(?)
Chip-chippin' at the walls of heartache.
Callin' out your name.
Go with a pail of heartbreak


And the faces there before me,
writing on and no tomorrow?
Your letter of goodbye,
is written on the walls of the heartache.
Oh yeah!


Breakin' down the walls of heartache, baby
I'm a carpenter of love and affection
Breakin' down the walls of heartache, baby
Got to tear down all the loneliness and tears
and build you up a house of love.
Yeah!

Breakin' down the walls of heartache, baby. (Yeah yeah!)
Shakin' down the walls of heartache!
Shakin' down the walls of heartache!
Shakin' down the walls of heartache!

Tearin' them down,
Tearin' them down,
watch me baby!
I'm a carpenter!
A carpenter of love!
Love and affection!
Brick by brick, tearing them down!
