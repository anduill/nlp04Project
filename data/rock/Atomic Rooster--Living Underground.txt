And In The Heat Of The Sun,
We Live, The People Living Underground.
Under The Shade Of The Fence,
We Have The Lovers Of Night Making Sounds.
(Are They Crying?) 
Well Here's A Message Going Round,
There's Not A Sound, There's Not A Sound.
It's The System Where There's Law,
We Want The Truth, The Secret's Living Underground.
(Living Underground) 
There Must Be More Ways Than One
To Do Help, To Help Me Carry On.
There Lies A Message Over There,
But No One Ever, No One Ever,Ever Really Cares.
(But Do They Know?) 
Well Here's A Message Going Round,
There's Not A Sound, There's Not A Sound.
It's The System Where There's Law,
We Want The Truth, The Secret's Living Underground.
(Living Underground) 
Living Underground, The Secret's Underground.
Living Underground, The Secret's Underground. 
Help, Help, Help, Help.
Living Underground.
