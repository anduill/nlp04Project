I'm gonna move, baby
Way out on the outskirts of town
Hey, I'm gonna move
Way out on the outskirts of town

I don't want nobody
Who's always hanging around

I'm gonna tell you baby
We're gonna move away from here
I don't want no ice, man
I'm gonna get me a Frigidaire

When we move
Way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody
Who's always hanging around

I'm gonna bring my own groceries
Gonna bring them everyday
That'll stop the grocery boy
Hey and keep him away

When we move
Way out on the outskirts of town
I don't need nobody
Always hanging around

It may seem funny honey
As funny as funny can be
But if we have any children
I want them all to look like me

When we move
Way out on the outskirts of town
I don't want nobody
Always hanging around
