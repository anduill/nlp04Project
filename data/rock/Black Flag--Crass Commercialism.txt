She's black, everything I need, everything I have
She's black, everything I need, everything I have
She's black, my love is true, so true to you
She's black, everything I love, she's everything I have
*	 she's black
Everything I see
Take me back
She's black
She's black, I've been had, everything I hate
She's black, it's out of my hands, everything I hate
She's black, my love is true, my love so true to you
Now she's black every night and day, and I love you

*
Now she's black, your baby's been had
Now she's black, your boy's been had, black!
Now she's black, your silly boy's been used up
Now your baby's all used up, little boy black
I'm black, let me in! I'm black
Black, dying at your door, take me back!
Black! let me rot at your feet, let me in!
Black! black! black!
