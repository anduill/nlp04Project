Step aside, step aside
The crew's gonna take a ride
Better stand behind the barricade
Here comes, here comes, here comes the big parade

"So make way, so make way"
That's what the captain say
Down St. Charles and Esplanade
Here comes the big parade

Throw me somethin' mister
I wanna dance with your sister
Brass bands marchin' by
Throwing notes to the sky

There goes, well there goes
Second-liners and flambeaus
I'm feelin' even better than the day I was made
Here comes, here comes, here comes the big parade

Throw me somethin' mister
I wanna dance with your sister
Brass bands marchin' by
Throwing notes to the sky

There goes, there goes
Well there goes, there goes
Second-liners and the flambeaus
I'm feelin' even better than the day I was made
Here comes, here comes, here comes the big parade

Here it comes y'all, can you see it?
Pass me some of that flying chick, alright
Here comes the big parade
Here comes the big parade, little girl

Here comes the big parade, there comes the big parade
Here comes the big parade, little girl
Here comes the big parade, there comes the big parade
Here comes the big parade, you know to tell

Here comes the big parade, the big parade
Here comes the big parade
Here comes the big parade
Here comes the parade
