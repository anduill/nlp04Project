This is Headliner from Arrested Development, and I come here tonight
to give thanks to ithe rain, so brothers and sisters please put down your
umbrellas, you won't be needing those today...
Look to the clouds with the most rain coming from it, for without the
rain there's no me and there's no you...
I said a drip-drop, a drip-drop, drip-drop
viva bum bum bum drip-drop ...

Let it rain, let it rain, let God's water feed me
The water of life, mentally rinsing me, physically drenching me
Most are frowning upon your arrival
but I need you for survival
And when you fall on my community
I run outside to properly
greet you
Let it rain, take my pain, I'm glad to meet you
Fill my eyes with a colorful rainbow
Every drop hits me, fills me
with an unmeasurable amount of security
knowing my God acknowledges me
as if each drop of rain is aimed toward me
my Lord: Thanks for life [Thanks for my rain]
my Lord: Thanks for life [Thanks for my rain]

[CHORUS:]
It's raining revolution
It's raining solutions

It's raining revolution (7x)

I struttle strut thru the ghetto
The rain this time I feel is mental
The goal of this rain I feel is spiritual
Saw thru the eyes of the inflicted people
Their eyes are hard as a million thombstones
marked with the names of the millions of kin thrown
to the dust that gave them their colored skin
Fade to black is the scene they're embalmed in
The rain many nights have witnessed her
Receiving the sperm of a brother into a sister
and blessed that life to guaranteed existence
A conscious baby for a black resistance
I feel the rain enhances the revolution
and reminds us of a spiritual solution
and reminds us of an unnatural supernatural solu-lu-lu-lution

[CHORUS]

Lost between reality and psychology. 1990's mentality is described
by the honorable thruth message which is 'True Knowledge Is So Priceless'
which is so true...
Rain, rain, stay here ! Wow !
Love that power !
Brothers and sisters -haha-
Raise your hands up high and let me see the colors of your beautiful skin
Now the ceremony begins
Lord, let thet heavenly rains cleanse
Run into your nearest rainbow
to grab, hold, to ride on
Each color, learn it ! The importance of each color...oh yeah
Let it rain (repeats till end)
haha
yes
oh yeah
