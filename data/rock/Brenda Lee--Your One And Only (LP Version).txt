You're the last one I think of when I lay down to sleep
You're the first one I dream of every morning
And it wouldn't be too hard for you to make my life complete
Can't you see it's meant to be you're the only one for me?
So why can't I be your one and only?

It's no wonder you can't see me with all those Johnny one-time
Hangin' round my love's steady as the rock of Gibraltar
Stand by me, you'll walk on solid ground...
