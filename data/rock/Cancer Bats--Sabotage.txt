Can't stand it, 
I know you planned it, 
I'ma set it straight, 
This Watergate.

Can't stand rocking when I'm up to here, 
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear.
So, while you sit back and wonder why, 
I got this fucking thorn in my side.
Oh my god, it's a mirage.
I'm telling y'all it's sabotage.

So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothing.
You shut me down with a push of your button.
But yo, I'm out and I'm gone.
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on.

'Cause what you see you might not get, 
And you can bet, so don't you get souped yet.
Scheming on a thing that's a mirage, 
I tell you now it's sabotage.

Why?

Listen all y'all this is sabotage.
Listen all y'all this is sabotage.
Listen all y'all this is sabotage.
Listen all y'all this is sabotage.

Can't stand it, 
I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, 
This Watergate.

Can't stand rocking when I'm in this place.
Because you're so disgraced, 'cause you're all in my face.
Make no mistake when I switch up the channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's a mirage.
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
