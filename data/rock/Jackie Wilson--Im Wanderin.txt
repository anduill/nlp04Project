I’m wandering, been moving to and from
Just wandering, with no place to go
Since I lost you, lost you, all I ever do
Is be wandering, till I wander back to you

Oh, I’m wishing, been yearning for your kiss
Oh, I’ve been missing the warmth of your caress
Since I lost you, I lost you, all I ever do
Is be wandering, wandering, wandering, wandering
I’ll be wandering, till I wander back to you

I look on every corner, down every dismal street
Are you there? Are you there? Oh darling, I repeat
I visit all familiar places, there’s no one there but me
Where can you be? Where can you be? Oh darling, where can you be?

Oh, I’m praying, your touch for me has grown
And I’m saying, for before it’s not been known
I love you, I love you, and all I ever do
Is be wandering, crying, wandering, wandering
I’ll be wandering, till I wander, till I wander back to you, yeah, oh yeah
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be wandering till I wander back to you, yeah, yeah
Wandering back to you
