Awaken from the bliss of sleep
The daybreak haunts you in such a subtle light
I hear them, they tell me these roads we have travelled fork up beyond the bend
Beneath the flutter of desperate wings they sing a song of reclamation
Where tomorrow's hanging horizon interrupts the hum of electrical towers
Here - there are the shallow graves
The shallower romances
And the shallowest of words still to be spoken
And there you are with open ears
Locust reign on your parade
