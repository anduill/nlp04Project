Mama can I huh, Mama can I huh, huh
Can I mama, won't you please let me, Mama can I, huh
Thats the sweetest little dress, Sally where'd you get the pattern
Made me one just like it out of yellow dotted swiss
Yes I guess we got the earliest garden in the county
Beneath the strawberries are a heap of snappin greenbeans
(It's been so long since I saw you, Hows your family
Too bad about your boy)
Mama make Willie quit pulling at my hair
Mama ouch! ouch! Mama, just make Willie quit it
Tommy if ya don't put down that stick
I'm gonna wear you out with it, boy, be quick
Come quick, Sammy Jean stuck her finger in a Coke bottle
Can't get it out cause its stuck, stuck, stuck
(Dad finally had his operation
You know how he is at putting off things)
Now I told you my mama didn't raise no fool
I can do anything if I got the right tools
Mama can I huh, Mama can I huh, huh
Can I mama, won't you please let me, Mama can I, huh
The crops been failing, lord it sure is dry
You'd think that we'd a sprinkle by and by
(Family reunion)
Gonna tear you up girl, gonna get a switchin
Better Tell your cousin that your sorry that you hit her
(Abby MaGiunness in love with Aybel's oldest boy
It's opt to kill their ma)
If I told you once, its been a thousand times
Quit askin' your Uncle's for nickels and dimes
Mama make Willie quit it, pulling at my hair
Mama ouch! ouch! Mama, just make Willie quit it
I told you my mama didn't raise no fool
I can do anything if I got the right tools
(Family reunion)
Did it again, put her finger in a Coke bottle
Can't get it out cause its stuck stuck stuck
(I heard this mornin' they dropped the Tallahatchie river
And found poor Billie gone)
Ah a little head cold, thats all ya have
You fix it right up with a jar of Vic's salve
Its the first time ever that the family's been together
Its so nice that we all get along so well
(Family reunion)
He's got the money, you'd think that he'd
Try and do something for his mama before she died
Now I don't mean to criticize your cookin', no I don't
But I think that ya could add a little bit of pepper
(Harvey, I'd love to have your recipe, is that the cake you served last Sunday)
I told you my mama didn't raise no fool
I can do anything if I got the right tools
Mama make Willie quit, bitin' at me
Mama ouch! ouch! Mama, just make Willie quit it
Why yes, I guess
And don't ya look nice in your Sunday dress
Doesn't Sally look tacky in her silly little dress
You can see that she just doesn't know no better
(Can you imagine, she let her daughter Rosalie
Go off to Memphis by herself)
Mama can I huh, Mama can I huh, huh
Can I mama, won't you please let me, Mama can I, huh
