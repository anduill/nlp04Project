My heart is in Rosa Rio under the Argentine skies
There with a beautiful lady with her dark and sparkling eyes
My heart is in Rosa Rio your sentimental eye aye
There with a beautiful lady that I love the day that I die aye aye aye
The parents were rich Estenaciaros and I was just the one of the hands
Who herded their ten thousand cattle on their ten thousand acres of land
But I was a very poor cowboy and we lived in worlds far apart
So how could I tell her I loved her or speak of the love in my heart
The lady I loved never loved me the lady I loved never knew
The day that she married another a poor cowboy's heart broke in two
I know that she'll never miss me or notice that I'm even gone
The cowboy who saddled her pony now rides through the dark night alone
My heart is in Rosa Rio...
