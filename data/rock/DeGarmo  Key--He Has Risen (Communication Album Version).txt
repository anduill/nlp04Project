Hear me every nation
Listen to these words
Come and find salvation
He has come to earth
Dressed in humble fashion
Hated and despised
Jesus with compassion
Opened paradise

He has risen
Raised in majesty
He has risen
Risen is our King

Triumph over sadness
Death where is thy sting
Gloom has turn to gladness
Risen is our King

He has risen
Raised in majesty
He has risen
Risen is our King

Now there is hope, oh blessed hope
Hope from an empty grave
Now there is life, oh blessed life
Jesus has risen today

He has risen
Raised in majesty
He has risen
Risen is our King
