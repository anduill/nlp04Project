So good at doing what you don't do
Just trying to protect yourself and other fools like you
So well practiced in your deceit
Behind the high walls of stupidity, your endless conceit

Behind the locked door, the sleeping dog you beat
I hope I see the day she satisfies her teeth
Give back to the native, their treaty land
What you preach, you preach for others?
Why don't you practice that firsthand?

I just don't understand, this world of mine
I must be out of step or out of my mind

And will the profits of destruction
Forever make your eyes blind
Do you bow to the corporations?
'Cause they pay their bills on time

God bless Elijah, with the feather in his hand
Stop stealing the Indian land
Stop stealing the Indian land
Stop stealing the Indian land
