Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to go.
Goodbye to all the souls
Who sailed with me so long.

The day has come at last
The sail strength at the mast
The years have quickly passed away.

Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to say
Goodbye to all my friends
Who've sailed with me along the way.

The bells have all been rung
The songs have all been sung
This long river has run its course.

Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to go.
Goodbye to all the souls
Who sailed with me so long.

The coffee pot is cold
The jokes have all been told
The last stone has been rolled away.

Goodbye to all my friends
The time has come for me to say
Goodbye to all the souls
Who've sailed with me along the way.
Goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye.
