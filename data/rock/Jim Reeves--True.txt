It's true, I know it's true, I'm losing you
And it's breaking my heart
It's true, I know we're through
There's someone new, it just tears me apart.

I don't know what I'll do without you
I've loved you for so long
I've built my whole world around you
And I just can't believe that you're gone.

But it's true, I know it's true, my dreams are through
And they'll never come true.

I've built my whole world around you
And I just can't believe that you're gone
But it's true, I know it's true, my dreams are through
And they'll never come true...
