Strangers in my backyard
Selling you beliefs
Danger in my empire
Trouble on the streets

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to rearrange
I don't want to fix up
And I don't want to change

Hold on
To the things that you love
Hold on
To the things that you love
Hold on

Danger in the papers
Danger in the magazines
Sell you ideas
Sell you false dreams

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to rearrange
I don't want to fix up
And I don't want to change

Hold on
To the things you can feel
Hold on
To the things that are real
Hold on

Strangers in my backyard
Selling you beliefs
Danger in my empire
Trouble on the streets

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to change
I don't want to fix up
I don't want to rearrange

Hold on
To the things you feel
Hold on
To the things that are real

Hold on
To the things that you love
Hold on
To the things that you love

Hold on
To the things you believe
Hold on
To the things that you see

Hold on
To the one that you love
Hold on
To the one that you love
