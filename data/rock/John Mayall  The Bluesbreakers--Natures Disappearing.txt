Man's a filthy creature
Raping water, land and air
Tomorrow may be too late
Now's the time to be aware
Nature's disappearing
Is going down, do you care?

Garbage going nowhere
I got a land fill at my door
Lakes and rivers stagnant
Nothing lives or grows like years before
Nature's disappearing
If you take for granted soon no more

[Incomprehensible] recycling
Instead of being burnable
Boycott at the market
Containers that are non-returnable
Aluminum, glass or plastic
They're rarely destructible

We are the generation
That may live out our natural time
But as for all our children
Born to suffocate in human slime
Nature's disappearing
And we are guilty of a massive crime
