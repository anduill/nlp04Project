I’m still in bed with you
And i forgive all the things you do
Stop for a moment rantin’ and ravin’
Your demons get me down

What should i do with you?
Knock you down, or storm out like a fool?
It ain’t over until we’re sober
Stop dissin’ me around

You keep naggin’ at me night and day
I just wanna make it fade away

You got me walkin’
Walkin’away
I count the reasons and still i stay
You keep on talkin’ with nothin’ to say
I feel like walkin’
Walkin’ away

Still in bed with you
You stab my back, you’re so goddam cruel
Hey, don’t you get it ?
I’ll never let it tear either of us down

You got me walkin’
Walkin’ away
I count the reasons and still i stay
You keep on talkin’ with nothin’ to say
You got me walkin’
Walkin’ away

You keep naggin’ at me night and day
I just wanna make it fade away

You got me walkin’
Walkin’ away…
