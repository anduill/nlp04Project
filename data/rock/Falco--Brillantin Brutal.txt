We are talking 'bout inside outside
Traces of time, spare us
The front is where we are, if we're in the back
Then the back is the front, mercilessly

And what everyone here knows
It's still too hot for that
No plastic money at the bar
What do I see oh lala - wonderful

Put up the leg, step in
Our dance, it must be the next
Play again, Sam do it again
We dance again the Brillantin' Brutal

Still talking 'bout software, hardware
Going nowhere, we've had that already
Hot, dressed in fur
Every heart suffers
Pain, it's the love's john

And what everyone here knows
Lust and luxury take their price
Accept no credit cards at the bar,
What do I see oh lala - wonderful

Put up the leg, step in
Our dance, must be the next
Play again, Sam, do it again
Do you want the shots to sound in Club Fatal

Get it up, don't give up
I see clearly a new case
Get it up, don't give up
In any case Brillantin' Brutal

Ancora coca co - ancora cora coca - ancora coca co - coca
Ancora coca co - ancora cora coca - What's the last word they said, man ?
allright

Up the leg...

Play again - c'mon Sam
Let us hear that tune
do it again
play
