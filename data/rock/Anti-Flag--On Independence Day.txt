I saw right through your eyes. 
I saw right through your guise. 
Every word that left you lips was 
just a covert disguise to hide your absent mind. 
You live and breathe. 
Sleep and drink. 
Beg and plead. 
Blind, diseased. 
No water can wash the blood off your hands. 
On Independence Day. 
Traded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Exchanged for Vietnamese lives. 
Bombs filled the Cambodian skies. 
In East Timor you stood up for the wrong side.
