To the lions
as she closes her doors
to end this night
this raging sea
won't have you
this weary grave
won't keep you
these tired arms
won't hold you
as she closes her doors
to the lions
inferno dreams
won't leave you
this moonless night
won't guide you
these brittle ghosts
won't love you
as she closes her doors
queen of guilt
queen of grief
remember them
