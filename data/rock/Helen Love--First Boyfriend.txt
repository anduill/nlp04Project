Met her boyfriend by the escalator
May the 14th 1978
She drunk his Cola, said “See ya later”
That was their very first date
Spent all summer in the skate city
He was the king of the blacktop
Like Tony Alva in the Lords of Dogtown
Eating chips down the Tottenham Court Road
Smoking menthol fags and dancing to the Buzzcocks
Every Saturday night it would be
All summer long hiding her love-bites
Kryptonics and 360's

16 years going on 17
Hot summer nights and new scenes
New wave and punk rock music
Come on, baby, lets get to it

Hey I love you! You're my first boyfriend
I'll love you to the end
Hey I love you! You're my first boyfriend
I painted your name on every subway wall in town

Holding hands, kissing on the night bus
Top deck, outta sight
Throwing fags and laughing at the skinheads
Down the front, having a fight
Saturday morning, Surrey Skateboards
Checking out the trucks and wheels
Somebody said that Stacey Peralta
Is outside doing a 720
Love; kiss, run: sing; shout jump!
Every day is a summer day
On the last bus home
Kissing and cuddling
Punk rock nights and skateboard days

16 years going on 17
Hot summer nights and new scenes
New wave and punk rock music
Come on, baby, lets get to it

Hey I love you! You're my first boyfriend
I'll love you to the end
Hey I love you! You're my first boyfriend
I painted your name on every subway wall in town

You were hanging off the lions in Trafalgar Square
You had Tartan trousers and orange hair
It was a hot summer day and there were skateboarders everywhere
I took a chance, I didn't care
If I shut my eyes I'm straight back there
In the sunshine, holding hands with my first boyfriend
