Another town, another place
The lonely streets where we embraced
Then you are gone without a trace
Nothing's the same without you

Another day goes passing by
I sit alone and wonder why
Sometimes it's hard but I will try
To live my life without you

You're in my heart, and in my dreams
You're everywhere or so it seems
So many times I've heard that song
Hold back the tears and tell you're strong 

Another day goes slowly by
I sit alone and wonder why
I think of you and start to cry
Nothing's the same without you

Another time, another place
The sweetness of our last embrace
What would I give to see your face
Nothing's the same without you
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same without you
