In the morning, don't say you love me 
'cause I'll only kick you out of the door 

I know your name is Rita 
'cause your perfum smelling sweeter 
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar 

Won't need to much pursuading 
I don't mean to sound degrading 
But with a face like that 
You got nothing to laugh about 

Red lips hair and fingernails 
I hear your a mean old jezabel 
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards 

Stay with me, stay with me 
For tonight you better stay with me 
Stay with me, stay with me 
For tonight you better stay with me 

So in the morning, please don't say you love me 
'cause you know I'll only kick you out the door 

Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home 
You can even use my best colonge 
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up 

Come on now 
Stay with me, stay with me 
'cause tonight you're gonna stay with me 
Sit down, get up, get down 

Stay with me, stay with me 
'cause tonight you're gonna stay with me 
Hey, what's your name again 
Oh no, get down, wooo
