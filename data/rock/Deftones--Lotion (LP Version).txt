I meant to come back to put out bliss
But the style is crumbling, covered canned
It was sick and no you don't even know how it comes
Shifts then gets ruined by you fucking slobs

But it's classical anyways

I can't help it makes me so sick over and over
It sits stiff bound with no heart
Fine cause this is where the separation starts arising
I can see it coming over your cloud

It's classical anyways
How cool are you?
I remember...
I feel sick (4x)

Just a bad call, it's so funny how you think
It's classical anyways
How cool are you?
I remember...
I feel sick (4x)
I'm so serious but that's not it
The thing is I don't give enough to actually give a fuck
You're plain boring and you bore me asleep

And I feel sickened
And who the fuck are you anyway you suck
It's making sick sense
Seeing how you're sticking out hardly and hoping money
Please arise up off the fucking knees
And hop off the train for a second
And try to find your own fucking heart

It's classical anyways
How cool are you?
I remember
I feel sick (4x)
Feel sick God (8x)
I feel sick right here (7x)
I feel sick!
