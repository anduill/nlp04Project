Sandra met Raymond
At the race relations
Much to the dismay
Of her family and friends

The love that we have is so important

The time that it takes
To make a baby
Can be the time it takes
To make a cup of tea

The love that we have is so important

He still goes dancing
And she still cuts hair
They put the baby
Into council care

The love that we have is so important

The love that we have is so important
