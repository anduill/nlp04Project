I will not fade
I won't let my light go out
I will not masquerade
I know who I am, and what my purpose is all about
(chorus)
For all these years
I've traveled on 
And you have cheered,
Shine on, shine on
What I am 
And who I am
Is never gonna change
The hits will come
But I will not be swayed
I've always been
What I am
The world can clearly see
I won't fade away
There is no life
That I would rather live
I will continue on
Until you take me home
(chorus)
I don't run
When stormy skies appear, I pray
Oh the power
I possess when skies turn black
I still burn 
The light's on
What I am 
And who I am
Is never gonna change
The hits will come
But I will not be swayed
I've always been
What I am
The world can clearly see
I won't fade away
What I am 
And who I am
Is never gonna change
The hits will come
But I will not be swayed
I've always been
What I am
The world can clearly see
I won't fade away
What I am...
