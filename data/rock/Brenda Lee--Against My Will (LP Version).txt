Loving you the way I do, is against my will
I keep hanging on
When I know it's wrong, this love I feel.

You're with her, I'm with him
Oh what pain this heartache brings
Loving you against my will.

Against my will, a flame is burning
Way down deep in my heart
Against my will, this way that I'm feeling
Is tearing me apart.

You hold her, I hold him
Wishing I didn't want you still
'Cause loving you is against my will.

Against my will, a flame is burning
Way down deep in my heart
Against my will, this way that I'm feeling
Is tearing me apart.

You hold her, I hold him
Wishing I didn't want you still
Loving you against my will.

Ah, loving you against my will...
