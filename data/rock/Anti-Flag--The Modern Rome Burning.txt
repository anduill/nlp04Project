How did we get into this mess?
The question is a hypothetical...
The answers are 
Written on the face of the oppressed

Sent to death at just nineteen
Forevermore to be unseen
His mother with tears in her eyes
Crying to god, she calls out "Why?!"

She'll find her answers
On the face of the oppressed

I bow my head in respect
Of the dead

Because we're all bogged down
And there ain't no fucking S.O.S.
That's gonna save our sinking ship
Because we're all bogged down
No, there ain't no fucking S.O.S.
That's gonna save our sinking ship
Our ship

How did we get into this mess?
The question is a bona fide literal
The answers are
Written on the face of the oppressed

We all know the answers why
They sold a lie to build Versailles!
You can roll over and die
Or you can rain down hell tonight!

You'll find your answer
On the face of the oppressed

I bow my head in respect
Of the dead

Because we're all bogged down
And there ain't no fucking S.O.S.
That's gonna save our sinking ship
Because we're all bogged down
No, there ain't no fucking S.O.S.
That's gonna save our sinking ship
Our ship
