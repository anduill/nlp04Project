I'm going down 
Down, down, down, down, down 
I'm going down 
Down, down, down, down, down 
I got my big feet on the ground 

I'm going down 
Down, down, down, down, down 
I'm going down 
Going back underground 

Oh, let me down without a sound 

I'm going down 
Down, down, down 
I'm going down 
Down, down, down, down, down 

You gonna miss me when I'm gone 
Me when, when all your tears are gone
