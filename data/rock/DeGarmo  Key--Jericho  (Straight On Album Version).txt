What will you do when your walls come down
You should've turned your heart, you should've turned it around
You felt that you were safe behind your iron and clay wall
I told you long ago that you were due for a fall

Jericho are you gonna be the slave
Of the master servants
Jericho all your scepters are burning
And the soldiers are coming for you

Your Wall Street idols won't be here long
From cinders to ashes and they are all gone
I begged you to run from your idols to me, yeah
Blind by fools' gold, now you just couldn't see

Jericho are you gonna be the slave
Of the master servants
Jericho all your scepters are burning
And the soldiers are coming for you, they're coming for you

Jericho are you gonna be the slave
Of the master servants
Jericho all your scepters are burning
And the soldiers are coming, coming for you, coming for you
