I know a place where the dogs ain't barking
I know a place where the sun don't shine
I know a place where the girls do the talking
In the back of my mind, in the back of my mind

I know a place, little thirteen year old cousin
Blood running high, got a knife in his hand
No daddy wouldn't do, yeah, those things to his mama
So he opened that blade and he stabbed that man
He opened that blade and he stabbed that man

I know a place and it goes no further
Than where you are, when you leave it behind
One piece of advice from one son to another
Get out of your mind, get out of your mind
Get out of your mind, yeah

I know a place, I know a place, oh
