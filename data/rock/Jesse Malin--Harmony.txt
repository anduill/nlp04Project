Hello, baby hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me?
Or are you still the same spoiled child?

Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go?
Am I the only man you ever had?
Or am I just the last surviving
Friend that you know?

Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea

Harmony, gee I really love you
And I wanna love you forever
Dream of the never, never
Never leaving Harmony

Hello, I said hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
Well, any case I set my own pace
By stealing the show, say hello, hello, no

Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea

Harmony, gee I really love you
And I wanna love you forever
Dream of the never, never
Never leaving Harmony

Harmony, Harmony
Harmony, oh Harmony
Harmony, oh Harmony
Harmony, oh Harmony
