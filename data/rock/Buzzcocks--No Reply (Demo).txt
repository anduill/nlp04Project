When I phone you night and day 
I get no reply no reply 
I keep writing those letters and send them away 
To get no reply no reply 

No reply oh can't you see 
No reply it's ruining me 
Even when I ask the reason why 
I get no reply no reply 
No reply no reply 

Oh no no no no no no no 
No reply no reply 
Oh no no no no no no no 
No reply no reply 

I'm bruising my knuckles knocking at your door 
To get no reply no reply 
I've stood it for so long but can't stand it no more 
To get no reply no reply 

No reply oh can't you see 
No reply it's ruining me 
Even when I ask the reason why 
I get no reply no reply 
No reply no reply 

Oh no no no no no no no 
No reply no reply 
Oh no no no no no no no 
No reply no reply
