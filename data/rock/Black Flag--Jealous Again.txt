You're jealous again 
No, she's just a friend 
Why can't I do anything without being yelled at? 
Always on the phone 
Never leave me alone 
Why don't you just tell me what you want from me 

Said I'll never leave you, no I'll never leave you 
It's not the end, no it's not the end 

I won't beat you up 
But I won't push you around 
Because if I do that the cops would grab me for doin' it 
I want to go and have some fun 
Go where the action is 
Who the hell are you to tell me who my friends are 

Said I'll never leave you, no I'll never leave you 
It's not the end, no it's not the end 

Said I'll never leave you, no I'll never leave you 
It's not the end, no it's not the end 

You're jealous again 
You're jealous again 
You're jealous again 
And again and again 
And again and again 
And again and again
