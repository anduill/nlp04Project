Awake, I am awake,
and I'm still alive out here,
awake, I am awake
and I'm still alive out here,
blinded, by this light,
it is all that surrounds me.

Deep water, I can smell the blood,
how long, how long before they come,
showing teeth, bearing fever, lost in open water,
until they find, finds us all, lost with all the shipwreck.

Deep water, I can smell the blood,
how long, how long before they come. 
Waves crashed upon the shore, and time and time again,
we lost control. Am I too far gone to be saved, 
lost in the water all alone, am I too far gone to be saved.
Lost in the water all alone, am I too far gone, too far gone to be saved. 

Waves crashed upon the shore, and time and time again, 
we lost control.
Waves crashed upon the shore, and time and time again, we lost control,
and I lost control.
