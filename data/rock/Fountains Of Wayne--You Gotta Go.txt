Sheepdog never seen a sheep in his life
Only an accountant and his drunk ass wife
House cat always gets worn as a hat
By the neighborhood brat, some kid named Matt
Jellyfish lying on the ocean floor
Doesn’t want to be a jellyfish no more
What are you trying to tell me?
What are you trying to sell me now?

Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
I hate to break it to you but you gotta go

(Strike fear) on the floor of the stock exchange
(High five) when I drive up to the driving range
(Light beer) at the bar people look at me strange
(Find free) parking meters when I’m all out of change
What are you trying to show me?
You don’t even know me now

Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
I hate to break it to you but you gotta go
Let’s go

You broke my heart and you sold it for parts
Borrowed my car now it won’t even start
You threw my keys in a pile of snow
I think you know, you gotta go

Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
I hate to break it to you but you gotta go
