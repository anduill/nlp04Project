LEFT HOME WITH A FRIEND OF MINE 
GONE TWO YEARS AND I DON'T KNOW WHY 
NOW I'M HAPPY ALL THE TIME 
I CAN'T THINK AND I'M FEELIN' FINE 
GIRL PUT ME IN A SITUATION 
GOING THROUGH SOFT CORE MUTATION 
THINK YOU HEARD THIS ALL BEFORE 
NOW YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME MORE 
I KNOW A PLACE WHERE DREAMS GET CRUSHED 
HOPES ARE SMASHED BUT THAT AIN'T MUCH 
VOLUNTARY EXPERIMENTATION 
GOING THROUGH SOFT CORE MUTATION 
I'M GOING UNDER 
DOWN UNDER WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE LOW 
TO A PLACE WHERE ALL THE MUTANTS GO 
DOING THINGS I NEVER DID BEFORE 
INSIDE OUT AND COMING BACK FOR MORE 
LITTLE GIRLS WITH THE FOUR RED LIPS 
NEVER KNEW IT COULD BE LIKE THIS 
YOU PUT ME IN A SITUATION 
GOIN' THROUGH SOFT CORE MUTATION
