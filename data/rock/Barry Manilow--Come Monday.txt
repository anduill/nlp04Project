In 3B it's Diane and she's makin' a plan
She says, "I'm gonna change my hair
It just don't fit my face anymore
I'm gettin' out of here
I just don't like this place anymore"

Tired of all the stallin'
This time it's for good

Come Monday, come Monday, my life starts again
My new point of view is beginning
Come Monday, that one day, my ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll
Come Monday, come Monday

Now here's Ken in 5N and he swears once again
He says, "I'm gonna lose the weight
I'm gonna get in to my clothes again
I'm gonna graduate
I'm gonna be the one who knows again"

No more lame excuses
Then it's understood

Come Monday, come Monday, my life starts again
My new point of view is beginning
Come Monday, that one day, my ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll
Come Monday, come Monday
Come Monday, come this Monday

Hey Bob, I'm changin' my job
Hey men, I'm making a plan
Yeah slim, I'm joinin' a gym
And this time I'm ready to roll

Come Monday, come Monday, my life starts again
My new point of view is beginning
Come Monday, that one day, my ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll
Come Monday, come Monday
Come this Monday, come this Monday
