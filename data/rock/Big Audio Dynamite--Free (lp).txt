If I do what I wanted
I Just don't have the time
I want to ride my motorcycle
Into the sunshine

My TV is laughin'
Makin' me feel small
Like I'm sad in a cell
All I can is these walls
And I never want to see another shopping mall

(Chorus)
Oh Free
To be what I will
Oh Free
I'll keep it up till
I'm Free
Or I won't have nothing at all
(End Chorus)

This is my life
I'm livin it, I will pay
But why should I care about all that today
I need a head start
And I don't want to stall
Gonna take a bulldozer to break down the walls
And I never want to see another shopping mall

(Chorus)

And I know 'bout all the graveyards
Tumble-down farms and shacks
I've gotta get out on the highway
And I'm not comin' back
There's a small town in the mountains where I'll do my thing
It's this Credit Card Livin' I find Stifling
I wanna see the river turning into the falls
Been down for so long now I wanna stand tall
So I'm packing my belongings and fear into my hold-all
And I never wanna see another Shopping Mall
Shopping Mall

(Chorus)

(Flashback Soundbyte)
Once we get out of the 80's the 90's are gonna make the 60's look like the 50's

(Chorus)x2

(Flashback Soundbyte)
Woah! Whew! I aint had a rush like that since the Berkeley Riots!

(Instrumental Interlude)

(Flashback Soundbyte)x4
It should be kicking in by now

(Flashback Soundbyte)
Ugh. I actually got him.
