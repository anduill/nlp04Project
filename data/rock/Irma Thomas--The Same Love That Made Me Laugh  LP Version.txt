Your love is like a chunk of gold
 Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
 Hard to gain and hard to hold
 Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
 
 Like a rose that’s so soft to touch
 Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
 Love has gone and it hurts so much
 Hmm hmm hmm
 
 Well and why?
 Must the same love that made me laugh
 Make me cry? Hmm hmm hmm
 
 Well and why?
 Must the same love that made me laugh
 Make me cry? Hmm hmm hmm
 
 Well now you think of love as sitting’ on a mountain
 Think of it as being’ a great big rock
 Won’t you think before you started to roll it down?
 Because once you start it, you can’t make it stop,
 
 I’ve given oh ho all I have to give
 Hmm hmm hmm
 And if you don’t want me, I don’t want to live
 Hmm hmm hmm
 
 Well and why?
 Must the same love that made me laugh
 Make me cry? Hmm hmm hmm
