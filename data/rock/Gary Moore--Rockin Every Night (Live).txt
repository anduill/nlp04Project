Alright!
Let me tell you 'bout a place I know.
The kind of place where the kids all go.
Come along baby you can shake off your blues.
Don't be shy, you've got nothin' to lose.

We'll be rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day.
Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let me tell you about a girl I met.
She made it hard for me to forget.
She said
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies."
So I gave it to her straight between the eyes.

We were rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day.
Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day.
That's right, we were rockin'.
Alright!
You know what I mean.

I don't care if they call the cops.
I'm gonna keep on rockin' till the party stops.
You can leave if there's to much noise.
You know what they say
Boys will always be boys.
That's right.
You know what I mean.

Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day.
We were rockin' every night,
Rollin' till the break of day.
That's right, yeah!

I don't care if the neighbours shout.
I don't care if they kick me out.
I'll come right back and knock down the door.
'Cause when I start to rock
You know I always want more.
Always want more, just like my name says.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

Keep on rockin'.
Keep on rollin'.
Keep on rockin'.
Keep on rollin'
Every night.
