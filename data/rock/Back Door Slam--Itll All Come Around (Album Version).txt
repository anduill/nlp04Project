Take the time to find out what's been going wrong
Take the time to sit and take it in
Walk the line and find out who your friends are
Take the time and let the light shine in

It'll all come around
Soon as you figure it out
It'll all come around
So figure it out

Take a chance and never let it slip away
Take a chance and make the moment yours
Take a stance and hold your head up strong, proud
Take a chance and offer no remorse

It'll all come around
Soon as you figure it out
It'll all come around
So figure it out

Draw the line and you can start it all over
Draw the line, you can never cross it again
(It'll come around)

It'll all come around
Soon as you figure it out
It'll all come around
So figure it out

It'll all come around now
Yes it will, yes it will
It'll all come around now

It'll come around now

It'll come around now
Yes it will, yes it will
