I see the light in your eyes
It's getting dimmer everyday
I feel the bitter cut of your tongue, so lacking in it' grace
And the sadness on your tattooed face 

It seems to me my dear
When we are face to face
The truth is a rare prey
No matter how many tears
Are locked up inside you like pounding fear
And contrary to desire, like the reverse of me and you
Time never comes back
And leaves us nothing, nothing left to pursue

Da da da dat dat da dat da da dat da da
Turn off the waterworks baby,
They don't move me no more
You've got my boots but I'm already
Standing out side your door
And there's nothing left that we can repair anymore

It's good that I remembered, before you forget
I give you my heart, but you wanted my head
And there's nothing, nothing we don't deserve
And contrary to desire, like the reverse of me and you
Time never comes back
And leaves us nothing, nothing left to pursue

Da da da dat dat da dat da da dat da da
Turn off the waterworks baby,
They don't move me no more
You've got my boots but I'm already
Standing out side your door
And there's nothing left that we can repair anymore

Now there's a knucklehead, I had it painted red
Standing alone in the yard
We won't be riding together no more girl
Believe me, I take it hard
I take it hard, I take it hard, I take it hard
And contrary to desire,
Like the reverse of me and you
Time never comes back
And leaves us nothing, nothing left to pursue

Da da da dat dat da dat da da dat da da
Turn off the waterworks baby,
They don't move me no more
You've got my boots but I'm already
Standing out side your door
And there's nothing left that we can repair anymore
