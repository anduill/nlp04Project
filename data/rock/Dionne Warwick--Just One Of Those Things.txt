As Abelard said to Eloise
"Don't forget to drop a line to me, please"
As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear
"Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear"

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
It was just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
It was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun but it was just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started, started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So goodbye, goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun but it was just one of those
One of those things, just one of those things
