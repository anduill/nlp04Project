Monday morning, up at eight,
The bus comes early from the bottom estate,
The weekend was blue, and so are you,
Sad boy

Front seat, top deck, look at the view,
Wish you were 14 and going to school,
Can't forget what your girlfriend said to you
Last night - she said

You should put an advert in the music press,
'Sensitive boy needs a girl in a flowery dress',
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Need a stick to get rid of you,
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Can't get it off, can't get off on you

Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum

Bus pulls up in the middle of town,
But you don't go to work, you just hang around,
Take a degree in self-pity,
Sad boy

Sit in a cafe, buy a cup of tea,
Put the change in the bandit, lose 50p,
Going round in your head are the things that she said,
So hurtfully - she said

You should put an advert in the music press,
'Sensitive boy needs a girl in a flowery dress',
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Need a stick to get rid of you,
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Can't get it off, can't get off on you

Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum,
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble,
Bubble, bubble, bubblegum

You're like bubblegum, bubblegum
You're like bubblegum, bubblegum, she said
Bubblegum, bubblegum, she said
Bubblegum, bubblegum
