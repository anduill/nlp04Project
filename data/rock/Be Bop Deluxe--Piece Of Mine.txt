Came to me one rainy evening
Warmer then the setting sun
Took my love by the tigger
Shot me like a gun
Hold me like a baby
She laughed at my fears
Said now love don't you worry
Make everything so clear
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine

She's all right she's all right
She's all right
She's got piece of mine

Smiles like the Mona Lisa
Laughs like the sun
Kisses like the greatest lover
The world has ever known
Dance like Ginger Rogers
Sing like a nightingale
Makes love like an angel
Cause my soul to wail
She's all right she's all right
She's all right she's all right
She's got piece of mine

She's all right she's all right
She's all right
She's got piece of mine
