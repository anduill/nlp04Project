People watching from high places
Print their minds on others faces
See the world that turns upon them
So many thoughts lying far beyond them

Child of my kingdom
See the hand that wipes tears from my brain
Tears of a lifetime
So many hours days upon hours, nights upon time
Nights without time

You know for once in your life
You just don't want to be free
Because I'm leading you on to
just where you're leaving me
And you can follow the path
though there's no footsteps to see
I won't be leading you, leaving you child
I just keep driving you, driving you wild

You know for once in your life
You just don't want to be free
Because I'm leading you on to
just where you're leaving me
And you can follow the path
though there's no footsteps to see
I won't be leading you, leaving you child
I just keep driving you, driving you wild


Child of my kingdom
See the hand wiping tears from my brain
Catch the drops where minds plead within you
See the teeth that withdraw their sting from your eyes, your eyes

You know for once in your life
You just don't want to be free
Because I'm leading you on to
just where you're leaving me
And you can follow the path
though there's no footsteps to see
I won't be leading you, leaving you child
I just keep driving you, driving you wild

Child, child of my kingdom
You catch the tears where warmth lies bleeding from a
child of fire
swords are flashing in a light
and a tree full of dew drips
where you mind seeps to mine
and we cling to our fine religion
to our fine religion
in your dew, thoughts for all
mind upon mine
giving thoughts in thoughts
patterns put on your brain
as they stand at hand
in my garden
with the key
to my kingdom
