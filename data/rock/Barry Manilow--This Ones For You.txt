This one will never sell
They'll never understand
I don't even sing it well
I try but I just can't
But I sing it every night
And I fight to keep it in
Cause this one's for you
This one's for you

I've done a hundred songs
From fantasy to lies
But this one so real for me
That I'm the one who cries
And I sing it every night
And I fight to hide the tears
Cause this one's for you
This one's for you

This one's for you
Where ever you are
To say that nothing's been the same
Since we've been apart
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like every thing else I have
This one's for you ohhhhh

I've got it all it seem
For all it mean to me
But I sing of thing I miss
And things that use to be
And I wonder every night
If you might just miss me too
And I sing for you
I sing for you

This one's for you
Where ever I go
To say the things I should have said
Things that you should know
This one's to say that all I can do
Is hope that you will hear me sing
Cause this one's for you ohhhh

This one's for you
Where ever you are
To say that nothin been the same
Since we been apart ohhhh
This one's for all the love we once knew
Like every thing else I have
This one's for you
