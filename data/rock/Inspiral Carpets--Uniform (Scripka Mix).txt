Father, it's time to leave
Tears on my face
And on your sleeve
And on your shoulder
I'm going down
In uniform
I'm going down
I'm going down
In uniform

Mother, it's time to go
The days will be long
And go too slow
But I'll think of you
As I go down
In uniform

You'll find me wandering alone on some far-off horizon
Wearing expressions like you've never seen on this face
The cars on the highway are backed up and bumper to bumper
It's a funny old world
It's a funny old human race

Little sister, you look so good
I feel proud of you
I knew I would
We'll be together
As we go down
In uniform
We're going down
We're going down
In uniform

You'll find me wandering alone on some far-off horizon
Wearing expressions like you've never seen on this face
The cars on the highway are backed up and bumper to bumper
It's a funny old world
It's a funny old human race

You'll find me wandering alone on some far-off horizon
Wearing expressions like you've never seen on this face
The cars on the highway are backed up and bumper to bumper
It's a funny old world
It's a funny old human race
