She's my lover, uh huh
You know, she's my friend
Well she's my baby, she's a hen
But she's sassy, and she's sly
I love evil hearted Ada
I love evil hearted Ada
I love evil hearted Ada
Till I die
She's a ruby, she's a plumb
She's an emerald, she's a girl
She always gives me money to spend
I love evil hearted Ada
I love evil hearted Ada
I love evil hearted Ada
Till The End

She can open up your eyes
She can open up a door
Don't let her take you by surprise
She can pull away the floor

Don't need money, unh-uh
You know I don't need fame
For I'm a rich man, that's right
Just the same
Got me a big piece..of the sky
I love evil hearted Ada
I love evil hearted Ada
Evil hearted Ada till I die
