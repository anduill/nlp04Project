I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
It bathed my heart in love and it wrote my name above
And just a little talk with my Jesus made me whole
Have a little talk with Jesus tell him all about our troubles
Hear our fainted cry answer by and by
Feel a little prayer wheel turning know a little fire is burning
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
Sometimes my path grows drear without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
Have a little talk with Jesus...
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to him in prayer he knows my every care
And just a little talk with my Jesus makes it right
Have a little talk with Jesus...
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
