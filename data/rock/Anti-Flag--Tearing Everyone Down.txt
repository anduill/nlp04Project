i thought i'd begun to see a change but the more things change, the more they stay the same back stabbing and name calling, the trade marks of your act you talk and talk of unity, but divide with your attacks (you say), "i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, but i'm too busy... tearing everyone down..." all us kids, we try to make a change some kids start a band, others start a zine you, no matter what your path you throw a curve in what could be achieved, then give up and move onto some other thing (you say), "i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, but i'm too busy... tearing everyone down..." take a break from your fights, try to open up your mind tonight when you feel that's complete then we can tackle this society! you may not like everything in life i do... but that doesn't mean, i'm not trying to change the same problems as you (you say), "i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, i'd like to see a change, but i'm too busy... tearing everyone down..."
