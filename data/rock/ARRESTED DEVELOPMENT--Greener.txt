(And the people go-Hey ahh) 
Mix the sunshine add some rain 
A pinch of loving sow a seed and… 
The grass can be greener on the other side 
( And the people go-Hey ahh)

(Speech) 
Friends of mine worry about they welfare 
They not really doing well they just doing fare 
Without medical healthcare pockets bare 
Hiding dey car far from repo man 
Checkin caller id before they answer they phone 
Bill collectors call round the clock at they home 
But they still wanna gone & replace they light bulbs 
Blacks want to be green we wanna recycle 
Many of us poor so we take the mass transport 
Walk streets bump beats that’s what the headphones are for 
No SUV’s steady spilling mad smoke 
All the baller images is just us in the video 
Most people that I know is on foot 
Living green naturally it’s all good 
I -Recycle cans and paper goods in my hood son 
No trash mouth cuz trash is better in a dump 
The grass can be greener on the other side 
(and the people go-Hey ahh)

(1 Love) 
I stopped to get gas at the citgo 
I saw a brother passing by throwing trash out his window 
I walked over and I picked it up 
It was a styrophome cup filled with cigarette butts ! w hat the…? 
He was thug and a litter bug 
I’m just trying to be a man that recycling 
See we support waste management 
And their efforts to prevent waste from piling up on each continent 
We separate the paper and elastic 
Then do the same with cardboard and plastic 
We take glass and bulbs filled with halogen 
And put aluminum and tin in a separate bin 
My next of kin yeah we heard about it 
But we’ve been letting al goers friends worry about it 
See where were from smog is hovering 
So I’m dedicating this verse to helping mother earth to recover

( Eshe) 
Organically we grow our trees 
Flowers blooming attracting buzzing boes 
Teach our kids how to plant seeds 
And nuture the harvest until the season comes 
From soil we feed from soil we feed 
Mix the sunshine add some rain 
A pinch of loving sow a seed and… 
The grass can be greener on the other side 
( and the people go-Hey ahh)

Life is filled with Challenges 
My boys Kidneys failed man he’s on Dialysis 
3 hours to filter his blood everyday 
We trying to learn more about the herbal remedies 
Get back to the way God meant for it to be 
Hanging with my peeps on the stoop being free 
Shoulda listened to the Indians and not the pilgrims 
The world warming up there’s much less chillin’ 
And yet where I’m from there ‘s still some convincing 
Older folks don’t trust the whites intentions 
Some think natural living is hocus pocus 
But with record high heat waves they taking notice

Mix the sunshine add some rain 
A pinch of loving sow a seed and .. 
The grass can be greener on the other side 
( and the people go-Hey ahh)
