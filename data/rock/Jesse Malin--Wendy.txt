Wendy left me all alone
No postcard or telephone
Wintertime down by the beach
In a jukebox bar way out of reach

She liked Tom Waits and the poet's hat
Sixties Kinks and Kerouac
Through the night her tailights fade
Her selection never played

I don't know I don't know I don't know why
Checkin' the tears and the light in your eyes
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If my little baby will make it alone

Wendy took me with a smile
Country lips and Bacall style
Through Tangiers or to Bombay
Her self-portrait in the USA
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
Checkin' the tears and the light in your eyes
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If my little baby will make it alone

Dreams 
Dyin' slowly
We don't want to be alone
Dreams
Dark and holy
We don't want to be alone

Thinking the things that I can't erase
Hole in my heart and a gun in my face
Feeling the things that I can't describe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why

Dreams 
Dyin' slowly
We don't want to be alone
Dreams
Dark and holy
We don't want to be alone

Wendy
Let down
Wendy
Get down
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
