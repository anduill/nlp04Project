I've been searchin' for somethin' I might never find
I've been looking for something I have left behind
I've been searchin' every day ok in the risin' sun
I've been trying to find my way till the day is done
I've been searchin'

I've been reachin' for something I might never touch
And I've been dreamin'
Of something that I want so much
I've been counting all the tears in the falling rain
I've been trying to hide my fears but it's all the same
And I don't know if I'll ever pass this way again

I can't wait until tomorrow
It's somethin' I might never see
I can't wait until tomorrow
For tomorrow never waits for me

I can't wait until tomorrow
It's somethin' I might never see
I can't wait until tomorrow
For tomorrow never waits for me

I've been searchin' for somethin' I might never find
And I've been looking for something I have left behind
I've been counting all the tears in the falling rain
I've been hiding all my fears but it's all the same
And I don't know if I'll ever pass this way again

I can't wait until tomorrow
It's somethin' I might never see
I can't wait until tomorrow
For tomorrow never waits for me

I can't wait until tomorrow
It's somethin' I might never see
I can't wait until tomorrow
For tomorrow never waits for me
