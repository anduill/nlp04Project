Lie in this place
Shows the world of disgrace
and let this room feel more like a tomb
white shirt
black tie
far and wide
so please she don't care
to get up on your feet

i'll been thinking of running out
Time never leaves you the same
anymore

Hopes and these fears
They will all disappear
under the sheets
for the night
to the day

I'll been thinking of running out
time never leaves you the same
Anymore

You will crash and burn
This time never learn
You will crash and burn
This time never learn
Never learn

I've been thinking of running
But time never leaves you the same
anymore

You will crash and burn
That time never learns
You will crash and burn
So that's why you will never learn

Crash and burn
Never learn
