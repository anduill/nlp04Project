You deceive me then you laugh
And now you're doing everything that you can
To try to win my love back

You made promises
You never kept
And yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

Never looked back
Never looked back
Yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

You were everything, so complete
And yes, I learned how to turn every trick
On the end of that leash

Oh ho, baby
I wanted you so bad
And yes I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

Never looked back
Never looked back
Yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

You were everything, so complete
And yes, I learned how to turn every trick
On the end of that leash

Oh ho, baby
I wanted you so bad
Yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

Never looked back
Never looked back
Yes I followed you to the end
And I never looked back

Never looked back
Never looked back
Yes, I followed you to the end
Followed you to the end

Yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back
Yes, I followed you to the end
And I never looked back
