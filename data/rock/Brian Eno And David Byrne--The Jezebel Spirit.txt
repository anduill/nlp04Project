Do you hear voices?
You do, so you are possessed
You are a believer, born again
And yet you hear voices and you are possessed
Okay, are you ready to give us a listen?

Put your hand over there
[Incomprehensible]
Okay sister, you have a Jezebel spirit within you?
You have a spirit of grief
You have a spirit of destruction

Jezebel, spirit of destruction, spirit of grief
I bind you with chains of iron
I bind you out of that bounded heaven
Loosen your hold and come out of her now

It's no good our sister, out, out, Jezebel
Come out now, go ahead, out in the name of Jesus
Come out destruction, come out destruction
Come out grief

Jezebel, you are going to listen to me, Jezebel
Go ahead sister, keep going, Jezebel will abandon you
She was intended by God to be a virtuous woman

You have no right to her
Her husband is the head of the house
Out Jezebel. out, out, let Jesus in

That's right, I break your power Jezebel
Loosen your hold on her mind
Go ahead sister, go ahead sister
Use your head [Incomprehensible]
That was easy
