Ooh, oh baby, go, oh yeah, well yeah
Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now, yeah

There ain't no change around you baby, you can go now
Ain't gonna hold you down or mess you up, now no how
Go now look for what you've been missing
Get it out of your system, follow your heart

Go, do it all, try everything, it's okay, baby
Go and have a ball, if that's your thing, baby, it's okay, baby
Go now, don't feel bad, there's no need to
That's the deal we agreed to right from the start

Oh baby, go, chase your world with its rainbow skies
It can make you sing or make you cry
And it can fill your heart with sorrow
Just like mine is now filled with sorrow

Go now, baby, go now, but remember me
(Yeah)
Tomorrow, remember me tomorrow, yes
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Go now, mmh

Go now, don't feel bad, there's no need to
That's the deal we agreed to right from the start
But remember me tomorrow
Remember me tomorrow

Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now
Go now, go now, go now

Yeah, go on now, baby
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby, go now
