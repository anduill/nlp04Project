And we're slow to acknowledge the knots on the laces
heart it races
and we go back to where we moved out to the places
heart it races
i bought it in a can and stirred it with my finger
singing boom-dadadadadadada boom-dadadada
through it out the window
and lately you've been tanned
suspicious for the winter with your
boom-dadadadadadada boom-dadadada
legs like little splinters
and we're slow to acknowledge the knots in the laces
heart it races
and we go back to where we move out to the places
heart it races
i sold it to a man and threw him out that window
he went boom-dadadadadadada boom-dadadada
made his wife a widow
heart it races alone
everybody go
Boom dadadadadadada boom dadadada
