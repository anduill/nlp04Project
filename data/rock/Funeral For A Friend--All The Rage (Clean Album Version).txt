Why do we need this 
Who was it that said 
That great things come to great men 
Well that fucker lied to us 
There's nothing here but a wasteland,

But I can still see the graves of the dead 
but it's useless 
most of us would rather sit 
than see this wound 
that we have created 
Let's not last the night 
Let's not last the night

I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy
I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy

Senseless and I'm not sure why 
I'm not going to pretend that I know all the answers 
Of all of these questions 
It's got to be good for something

So we'll chalk this up and we'll mount the dead 
on the fireplace above right above our guilded heads 

I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy
I'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy

Like sitting in the back seat (it's all the rage)
and boring me with your body (it's all the rage)
and how many times can I say I'm sorry (it's all the rage)
and really mean it (and really mean it)
and really mean it (and really mean it)
Like sitting in the back seat (it's all the rage)
and boring me with your body (it's all the rage)
and how many times can I say I'm sorry (it's all the rage)
and really mean it (and really mean it)
and really mean it (and really mean it)
and really mean it

Go

Why do we need this 
Who was it that said 
That great things come to great men 
Well that fucker lied to us 
There's nothing here but a wasteland
There's nothing here
