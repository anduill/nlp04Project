Surrounded by strangers
All my friends are gone
I ain't had the blues yet today
But I can feel them coming on

Everywhere I go
Trouble's all I find
No matter what I do
I feel like I'm losing my mind

Broke down on the Brazos
Broke down on the Brazos
Broke down on the Brazos

Living in a dream
Chasing a sound
Told everybody I believe
I'm Texas bound

Here I am
Well, I guess it's no surprise
Up to my knees in water
Up to my ears in dragonflies

Broke down on the Brazos
Broke down on the Brazos
About to lose my mind
About to lose my mind

Broke down on the Brazos
Broke down on the Brazos
Broke down on the Brazos
About to lose my mind
About to lose my mind
