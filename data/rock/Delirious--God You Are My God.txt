God You're my God, You're my God
God You're my God, You're my God
And I will seek You, yes, I will seek You
And I will seek You, yes, I will seek You

You satisfy my soul
You satisfy my soul
So I will praise You as long as I live
So I will praise You as long as I live

I've seen Your power and Your glory
You've let me see You in the sanctuary
Because Your love is better than my life
I will lift up my hands in sacrifice

We give You praise, give You praise
We give You praise, give You praise
For You are worthy, yes, You are worthy
Yes, You are worthy, yes, You are worthy

So I will praise You as long as I live
So I will praise You as long as I live
