ometimes life's no fun
There's days I've lost more than I've won
There lots of places that I've been to
Sometimes carrying my load alone without you
But there are things that I won't do
Everytime I get the blues
At times my heart gets heavy with doubt
I've come so close to checking out
Suddenly, you receive me
Silently, you believe in me
And I know you'll never let me down
I'll be alright come the morning
After tears fall down without warning
And you don't have to understand it
And you never ask me why, just hold me while I cry.
