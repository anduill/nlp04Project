She's been going steady with a boy called Eddie 
Staying out late every night 
Her dad's going mad 
and her mother is sad 
cuz they can't sleep at all cuz they're uptight. 

Says she likes to dance to My Chemical Romance 
She'll be dressed in black from head to toe 
"Standing by the fire, she looks like a vampire," 
says Uncle Stan to her Auntie Flo. 

Calm down Dad 
I'm growing up real fast 
I know what I'm doing 
I'm a teenager in love 

Calm down Dad 
nothin ever lasts 
I don't care what you've been told 
I'm still young and you're still old 
And the Clash were 30 years ago 

She believes the NME and everything they write 
They say London is the place to be 
She's gonna get a flat by Steve Lamacq 
with holes in her settee 

She said her boyfriend Eddie 
known people off the tele 
and they want to talk to me 
So see me in a _________ 
and never mind the Buzzcocks 
I'm gonna be on TV 

Calm down Dad 
I'm growing up real fast 
I know what I'm doing 
I'm a teenager in love 

Calm down Dad 
nothin ever lasts 
I don't care what you've been told 
I'm still young and you're still old 
and the Clash were 30 years ago 

Gonna sing like Kate Nash 
in a cockney accent 
even though she talks posh 
cuz I know where it's at 

There's nothing better in life than a snake bite 
and a kebab with chili sauce (ooh yummy) 
I'm not gonna work cuz work is for jerks 
I'm a punk rock girl with electric force 

And I'll travel around the world on a ten pound note 
on a silver black phantom bike 
and I'll sleep with a boy and I'll sleep with a girl 
and I'll decide which one I like 

Calm down Dad 
I'm growing up real fast 
I know what I'm doing 
I'm a teenager in love 

Calm down Dad 
nothin ever lasts 
I don't care what you've been told 
I'm still young and you're still old 
and the Clash were 30 years ago 

White Riot 
I wanna riot 
White riot 
a riot of my own 

White riot 
I wanna riot 
White riot 
a riot of my own
