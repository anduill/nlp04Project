Whooo-oo-Whoooo

This is my life I don't feel whole every night
I hear love, crying down on love so bright

Tell me to hear 
(I feel so good)
How can you tell
(I do believe)
It's just so real
(I really know)
I want to know
(I gotta say)

The Indian queen, pretty as a dream
The Indian queen, my love is so free

In the love, I hear all those melodies
In my love, lying down on separate ears

Oh, how can you tell
(I feel so good)
It's just so real
(I really know)
How do you know
(It's got to be) 
It's got to go
(It's still inside)

The Indian queen, pretty as a dream
The Indian queen, proud of eyes so clear

Whoo-oo-oo-Whoooooooo
It's my world, I'd save all my life for you
Ah-ah-ah
You can smile down on lovers' avenue

Well, how can you tell
(I want to know)
It's just so good
(Oh, yes I do)
I feel so right
(I really do)
It's so tight
(Come on now)

The Indian queen, pretty as a dream
The Indian queen, my love is so real

Whoooo-oooWhoooo
It's so real, you know like it's got to be
You say no and I wake up wanting you

Well, how can you stop 
(I feel this good)
You've got to be
(Oh, this is good)
It's just so real
(I wanna be)
Knowing you
(It's all so real)

The Indian queen, pretty as a dream
The Indian queen, My love is so real

Whooo-oo-Whoooo-oo 
Can I tell you 'bout an Indian queen
(fading...) She's gonna get her dream....
