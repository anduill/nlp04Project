Between the worlds are pearls
Around your lily white neck
So round, profound all shining beads of sweat
I know my way 'round your throat like a knife
I'll silver and steel you away to my island of sea jade
Crazy

Life a a love affair
All the girls declare it so
They know
I am a gigalo
Between the worlds I go I go
I go

Between the girls are worlds
That only lovers see
So proud the shroud has fallen to my knees
I know the sway of your charms like a snake
I'll give you my head
In a casket of silver and sea jade
Crazy

Life is a love affair
All the girls declare it so
They know
I am a gigalo
Between the worlds I go I go
I go
