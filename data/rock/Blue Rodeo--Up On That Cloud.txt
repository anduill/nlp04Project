Its so easy to fall in love with you
I know I did for a day or two
You never noticed lost in your crowd
Just no room for me up on that cloud

Cant find no changes for better in my luck
Empty are my eyes and my heart
Cold gray days, the nights are so long
My heart is sinking, bound to a stone

This old world is a bag of tricks
A whole lot of nothin' where nothin' ever fits
In all her glory, she just dont compare
The one single tear in your beautiful eyes, beautiful eyes

Thank you December for your cold gray air
Lakes are frozen, trees are bare
I once loved her of that I am proud
Just no room for me, up on that cloud

This old world it's a bag of tricks
A whole lot of nothin' where nothin' ever fits
In all her glory, she just dont compare
The one single tear in your beautiful eyes, beautiful eyes
