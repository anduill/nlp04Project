Young romans, boy

The laurel wreath, a new dance
Swings rhythm into the hips of the town
They see and know and say
What this night has to say

Don't ask for new old values
See white light, see only feeling
The night is ours till morning
We play every game

Don't ever let this journey end
The Doing comes only from the being
Only from dimensions, that
Are worth illusions and sensations
Give me more

Young romans - dance differently from the others
They love their sisters more, more than the rest of the world
Ask young romans - do you still know the sun,
It still knows the worries
Young romans - the night is young like you,
Forget tomorrow

A new dance brings rhythm at the sides of the city
We'll see each other, we'll find, we'll seek what to do
But do not look to make values die, and even sensation

The night is ours till the morning, we have illusion
is not the end of the trip, there is always a tomorrow and
There are dimensions, with illusions and sensations
Give me more ..."

Young romans - there is a night before each day
and that price is still to pay
Never stop this old erosion phantastic voyage
Young romans...

Young romans - do you still know the sun,
The night is young like you and yet
In the land where every dream has landed - you forget
Young romans - there is a night before each day
And that price is still to pay
Never stop this old erosion fantastic voyage.
