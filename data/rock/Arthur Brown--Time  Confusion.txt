Time Bending faces
Time Mending places
Time into time
One white hand
Holding silence
Collapses Extacey's of violence
Time into time Time
Let your fist open wide
You'll find the hand of the pattern Behind which we all hide
Change into time
A bubble of blood Shot from laughter
Circles death Before and after
Time beside time
