Here's to the maker
The film double taker
The illusion type faker
Guaranteed shaker, para vision viewer

Or it just may seem
Lost the real scope of life
The hope of life to cope with life
And found it on the screen

And how many times have we heard that line
Do you think I'm blind to trade my mind
For what you call fine
Never in my time I'm not in your movie

Hey, what can it be on the big white screen
Hey how can you see you're living in 3D

I guess you think you're
At the movies somewhere
Stale popcorn, don't you stand in your chair
Stale popcorn, don't you stand in your chair

A child is influenced by the make believe
To take advantage of this truth is cold hearted sin
So I say to youth right now, don't sway to the unjust
No matter what they say, never give in
