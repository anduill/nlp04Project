Welcome friends to Janice's Party
The kind that others have tried
Smoking is permitted inside

We have faith in Janice's Party
With friends who can not sing
And I can hear the doorbell ring

Well I came this far
Now I know that I won't sleep well tonite
Drunk out of my mind
Janice's party's alright, alright

Bah bah bah bah bah da da da da
Bah bah bah da da da
Bah da da da da da da

Here's a chip a vodka martini
Someone call me a car
I'll be underneath the bar

Well I came this far
Now I know that I won't sleep well tonite
Drunk out of my mind
Janice's party's alright, alright

(break) 

Well I came this far
Now I know that I won't sleep well tonite
Drunk out of my mind
Janice's party's alright, alright
