How you doin'?

I picture things a certain way 
then go back to it another day 
the green mind said it’s okay.

Cause you know where they’re gonna be
all’s you have to do is come with me
it’s cool, they’re probably asleep.

On the outside 
that’s where they always hide
come to my side
and I’ll introduce you to
some of their kind
I know you’ve always tried
and now it’s your time to take in their point of view
it’s nothing new.

I've been bouncing off the walls
I can’t hang with them for long
they’re cool, but I need you
on a certain level I think they’re great
but on another I can’t relate
to anything they do.

On the outside
might be with them tonight
unless you decide to call then I’ll check out you, babe

Hangin’ heavys such a routine
I’ve just begun to forget why I seldom n' try to break out of their scene
And now I Gotta work on you
so the frogs 'll hang and they’ll always be hangin’ 
now we’re here, what do we do?

I’ve been sortin’ through the pros and cons of your eyes, they’re webbed toes
can’t you help move it along? 
I been pickin’ through my thoughts
it’s a shame my judgement rots 
and I sure feel where I belong.

[solo] 

On the outside 
well it’ll be a while
I gotta unfry ’fore I pick it up with you, help me

Do I need that stable care? 
don’t I know that they’ll be there
does that cut now you’ve appeared?
Or do I need that stable core? 
or do I jump for something more?
are you all that I fear?, tell me

I been pickin’ through my thoughts 
it’s a shame my judgement rots
and I sure go where I belong.
It’s a call that’s tough to make
it could be a big mistake 
can’t you help move it along? 
If I keep stewin’ ’bout how I feel 
eventually you'll split, then I won’t have to deal
sounds like a plan.
But it’s kind of lame to let it slide
knowin’ either way I haven’t tried
can’t figure out where it all stands
in the green mind.
