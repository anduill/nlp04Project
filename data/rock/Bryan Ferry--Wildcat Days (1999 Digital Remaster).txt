Hanging 'round endlessly
Dog eat dog, dead end street
Dead end street
Dead end street

Brave new world
I can't break you down
I can see there is no ways out
No ways out
No ways out

Wild and free in the dead of night
I can dream, what I want I get
Out of touch with all that kitchen jive
Wildcat days, lonely nights
Lonely nights

Fair is foul, foul is fair
I cry out loud but there's no one there
The more we live, the most who die
Wildcat days, lonely nights

Lonely nights
Lonely nights
Lonely nights
Lonely nights
