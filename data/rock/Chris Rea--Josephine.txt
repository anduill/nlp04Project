Josephine


There's rain on my window
But I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
And every single step that I'll take
I'll take for you
My,Josephine

There's a storm on my radar
But I can still fly
Oh,and you are the reason
The blue in my sky
Josephine

A life without meaning
I was walking away
In the coldest of winters
Night becomes a day
Josephine, I'll send you all my love, 
And every single step that I'll take
I'll take for you
My,Josephine, I'll send you all my love, babe

Josephine, I'll send you all my love, babe
---and when I'm far away (oh, so far away)
I'll send you all my love
(bridge)
(chorus):
---- ...... I'll send you all my love
(Rea):
......Josephine...
---- ......I'll send you all my love
(Chorus):
---- ......I'll send you all my love
