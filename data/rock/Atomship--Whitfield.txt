Whole, wide, world!! 

There's a man outside and he's screaming that the elephants are trampling, trampling his father in his sleep. 
There's a girl outside and she's screaming that the world's on fire, on fire today. 

There's a man inside and he's screaming for his noon time pills at nine a.m. 
There's a girl outside and she's screaming at the whole wide world, one hair at a time. 

I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes still. 
Against the whole wide world, to make her love me. 
Whitfield was my world today. 
Love me. 
Against the whole wide world, cause she won't love me. 
Whitfield was my world. 

There's a man outside and he's screaming his father was never there. 
There's a girl inside and she's screaming at the whole wide world, one hair at a time. 
There's a boy outside and he's holding a picture unto his head. 
There's a girl inside who's scratch and the blood's on fire, on fire today. 

I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes still. 
Against the whole wide world, to make her love me. 
Whitfield was my world. 
Whole, wide, world, wide, world, wide, world, wide! [x3]

Against the whole wide world, to make her love me. 
Whitfield was my world today. 
Love me. 
Against the whole wide world, cause she won't love me. 
Whitfield was my world. 

The world's on fire...
