Gee, but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartet
That sang Sweet Adeline.

Goodbye forever old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever old sweethearts and pals
God Bless them
Gee, but I'd give the world to see
That old old gang of mine.

(Gee, but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine)
I can't forget that old quartet
That sang Sweet Adeline.

Goodbye forever old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever old sweethearts and pals
God Bless them
Gee, but I'd give the world to see
That old old gang of mine...
