I suffer from a tumor
here inside my chest
I gotta lay to rest
a strange kind of humor
the grin on your face
soon leaves without a trace
now I'm out of love
no one can fill this heart of mine
I ran out of love now
I'm out of 

put an end to yourself
and you'll be closer
closer

the world is
but a tumor
the cold light of day
won't turn the night away
humanity's a rumor
unless my soul reacts
the whole world my collapse
now I'm out of love
no one can heal this heart of mine
I've run out of love
now I'm out of
