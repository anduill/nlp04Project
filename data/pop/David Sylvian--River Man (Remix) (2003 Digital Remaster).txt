I see your eyes light up like fire
It`s medicine to me
But as the hunted live their lives
You`re keeping out of reach

So I keep running, falling
Till I reach the water
Run with me holy man
But when I reach out
I find I`m standing right beside her
Now we`re living
Blessed with all the thunder in the world

Now, should you ask me to come home
To wake up from the sleep
Like a boat inside a storm
Is there no hope for me?

So I keep running, falling
Wade into the water
Run with me river man
But when I reach out
I find I`m standing right beside her
Now we`re living
Blessed with all the thunder in the world
