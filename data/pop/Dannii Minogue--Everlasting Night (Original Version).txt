We got a party to go to tonight

Come tonight
Come tonight
Come tonight
Come tonight

Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right baby

Don't get up in the morning
There's no love to be found
I'll wake you up in the afternoon and
We'll watch the sun going down

Now we're free at last
So forget the past
It's the time to make it happen
Now we're free at last
So forget the past
Oh Whoa Whoa

Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right baby

Lovin' you in the daytime
When there's no-one around
Come again in the evening baby
That's where my love can be found

Now we're free at last
So forget the past
It's the time to make it happen
Now we're free at last
So forget the past
Oh Whoa Whoa

Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right baby

Everlasting Night Oh I
Everlasting Night Oh I

Oh Whoa Whoa baby

After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together
After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together
After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together
After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together
After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together
After the sun goes down we'll spend this everlasting night together

Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right baby

Everlasting Night Oh I
Everlasting Night Oh I

Oh Whoa Whoa

Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night
Everlasting Night and it feels so right baby
