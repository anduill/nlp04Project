[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning in a strange place
I looked into the mirror at a strange face
Then I looked for you but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely coming down
I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely coming down

[Verse 2]
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely coming down

[Outro]
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And again I felt the lonely coming down

Mmm
