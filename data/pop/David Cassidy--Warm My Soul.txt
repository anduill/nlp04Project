Hey, now woman, warm my soul
Shake the pain that grows inside me
From your love that's grown too old
I want you more
Running, jumping, leaping, hopping
Don't turn to go
Don't you turn, oh no

Can't you see me calling your name
In the middle of a dark, cold night
I need you so
Won't you please believe me when I say
'Hey girl, I love you so'
Wait till the morning comes
Never leave the heart you stole
Never leave me just some more
You're everything I ever wanted even more
Sick, stoned sick sleeping in the corner
Praying to the mighty Lord
Don't you turn to go
Don't turn, oh no

Can't you see me calling your name
In the middle of a dark, cold night
I need you so
Won't you please believe me when I say
'Hey girl, I love you so'
Wait till the morning comes
Never leave the heart you stole
Never leave me just some more
You're everything I ever wanted even more
Sick, stoned sick sleeping in the corner
Praying to the mighty Lord
Don't you turn to go
Don't turn, oh no
