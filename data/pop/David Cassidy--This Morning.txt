Where is the morning
I can't sleep tonight.
I found someone.
You smiled at me and said you were free
And I was alone.
Would you meet me again?
You needn't have asked.
I'll wait for you at dawn,
If this night will only pass.
But the clock hands refuse to move,
It's dark inside my room.
It must be daylight soon.
Where is the morning?
I can't believe
All my dismay.
Just had to pack and leave
When at last you looked my way.
And so to bed
but not to sleep.
It's only morning light
That will end this watch I keep.
But the stars shining ?cross the land
Don't seem to understand
How things get out of hand
Where is the morning?
