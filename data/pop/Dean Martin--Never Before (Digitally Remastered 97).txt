Never before has my heart felt a thrill like this
Never before, never before
Never before has the whole world stood still like this
As I gaze at the face I simply adore.

After today when they speak of our paradise
I'll smile and I'll say I've been there once or twice
For this is that once in a lifetime, the miracle of your kiss
I've never loved like this, never before.
