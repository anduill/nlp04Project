Hey boy, I wish you'd stop wishing, ooh ooh ooh 
Mmm ooh, yeah yeah yeah 
Wishing boy, ooh 

When I saw you the other day 
I smiled but you just turned away 
I had to say myself remember 
He likes to stay in his shell all alone 

As I went along on my way 
I knew you had so much to say 
The words were locked deep inside 
That's alright I'll give you every sign that I can 

Now I know a girl who's got a crush on you 
But she is just a little shy and a little proud 
Now you know you've had the time 
To think it through don't make me wait 
Another day, let it out 

I wish that you'd stop wishing 
And finally ask so we can get started 
On a love that will last 
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back 
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask 

As I sit here and make believe 
I know that you are watching me 
Your eyes are burning a hole through my heart 

If there's a place we can start let's begin 
Now it seems to me you want me to give in 
And make a move showing you that I care 
But my love is still a prize that you must win 
Don't waste a chance to take my heart while it's there 

I wish that you'd stop wishing 
And finally ask so we can get started 
On a love that will last 
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back 
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask 

Wanna get started now, can we get started now ooh 
I wanna get started now, yeah yeah 
Don't make me wait another day 
Cause you know you've had the time to think about me 
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back 
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask 

I wish that you'd stop wishing 
And finally ask so we can get started 
On a love that will last 
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back 
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask
