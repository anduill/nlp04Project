Take a bow, clap now
For whom we are about to deceive
The more the merrier the less to please
All rounded up and labelled sheep
God rest their souls and their minds he'll keep
Do you really need to rise to the occasion?
Give them all a standing ovation
You've paid the price, in time to see
Hurricane Carter versus Mohammed Ali
Take a bow, clap now
Take a bow, clap now
Displayed before your eyes, as comedy
Safe and harmless bring the whole family
Over the moon to take what's being given
Put lights in their eyes and they'll call it living
A night on the tiles at the talk of the town
A buzz in the air and an ear to the ground
A tout with tickets and they'll come in droves to see
Keith Moon, Sid Vicious and Brian Jones
Take a bow, clap now...
