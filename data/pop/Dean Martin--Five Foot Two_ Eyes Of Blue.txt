Five foot two, eyes of blue
But oh what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my gal?
Turned up nose and turned down hose
Never had another beau
Has anybody seen my gal?

Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Bet your life that it isn't hers
Could she love could she woo
Could she could she could she coo
Has anybody seen my gal?

Five foot two, eyes of blue
But oh what those five foot could do
Has anybody seen my gal?
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur
Diamond rings and all those things
Bet your life that it wasn't hers

Could she love and could she coo
Could she could she could she woo
Has anybody seen my gal...
