I like the meaning of your name
Are you aware, are you the same?
It goes with your eyes, your sentiment,
I like your name, Ezekiel
You're so serene it makes me mad
You're never down, ain't never sad
You won the pools, I bet you're glad
Your smile is fresh, Ezekiel

Looking philosophical
Looking philosophical
Sitting fresh faced over there, with broken sighs his heart
Speaks out to answer me
For I am the interpreter, of his dreams

Daydreaming makes your tea go cold
Gold earrings make my face look bold
Your compliments are never old,
Let's drink a toast, Ezekiel
God will strengthen all your love,
So pure, so kind, so noble love
You smell so sweet, like lavender buds
You smell so sweet

Can I come inside of your dreams?
Your vivid and exciting dreams
I'm not a timid as I seem, can I come in Ezekiel

My, my, my Ezekiel, shine your smile Ezekiel
Chat a while Ezekiel, you can count on me

Oh, I love the way you smile, come and sit and talk a while,
You can say that I love your style, you can count on me
