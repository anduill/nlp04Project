Baby, baby, baby hurt me bad 
Baby, baby 
Baby, baby made me cry 
Baby, I wanna die 

Somebody tell me where she's hiding out 
I gotta find that cheatin' gal 
Can't go, can't go, can't go sleep at night 
Can't sleep, can't sleep, it's not right 
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes 
Sunlight makes me rise 

I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around like you're in a big game 
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you 
Boo hoo 

Baby, baby, baby please come back 
Baby, baby 
Sunlight sunlight in my eyes 
Sunlight makes me rise 

I can't sleep until my baby says it's over 
I gotta hear it face to face 
I love you darlin' it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around like you're in a big game 
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you 
All the time 

I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around 
Like you're in a big game 
It's so unfair that you're so happy 
When I'm hurtin' inside 

I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame 
The way you run around 
Like you're in a big game 
I'm so unhappy I could cry 
Every time I think about you, boo hoo
