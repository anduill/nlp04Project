Eve, you wicked woman 
You done put your curse on me
Why didn't you just leave that apple 
Hangin' in the tree 
You make us hate our husbands 
Our lovers and our boss
Why I can't even 
Count the good friends 
I've already lost
'Cause of PMS blues, PMS blues 
I don't even like myself 
But it's something I can't help 
I got those God almighty 
Slap somebody 
PMS blues

Most times I'm easy going 
Some say I'm good as gold 
But when I PMS, I tell ya 
I turn mean and cold 
Those not afflicted with it
Are affected just the same
You poor ol' men 
Just have to grin 
And say I feel your pain
PMS Blues
Thats right, Brother. Well, what else are you gonna say
PMS Blues 
Lord, Lord
You know you must forgive us 
'Cause we care not what we do
I got those can't stop cryin'
Dishes flyin'
PMS Blues

But you know that we can't help it
We don't even know the cause
But as soon as this parts over 
Then comes the menopause
Oh, Lord, Lord
I 'm gonna always be a heap of fun
Like the devil taking over my body
Sufferin', sufferin', sufferin'... 
Everybody's sufferin'...aw 

But a woman had to write this song
A man would be scared to 
Lest he be called a chauvinist 
Or just fall victim to those 
PMS Blues
You know we'd kill for less than that
PMS Blues. Oh,oh... 
You don't want to cross my path
'Cause a pit bull ain't no match 
For these teeth a-clenchin'
Fluid retention
Head a-swellin' 
Can't stop yellin' 
Got no patience
I'm so hateful 
PMS Blues

Pre-Menstrual Syndrome
Got those mood's a-swinging
Tears a-slinging
Nothing fits me 
When it hits me
Rantin', Ravin'
Misbehavin' 
PMS Blues 

Can I get a witness
You women wanna witness 
Aw, tell it sister, tell it sister 
As only you know how
You men wanna witness
Aw, tell it brother, tell it
'Cause you sure know what I'm talking about. Ha
You little kids, you wanna witness
You wanna talk about that mean ol' devil mama of yours
I said the KIDS. You mamas, stay out of this, you done enough to them kids already
Come on kids, witness, you know you're safe with your friend Dolly
Its the only time in my life I ever think about wishing 
I'd've been a man
But you know...that only means one thing
Because if I'd've been a man
I'd be somewhere 
Right this very minute 
With some ole cranky, naggin', raggin', hateful woman 
With those ol' 
PMS Blues. PMS Blues
I don't wanna talk about it
We both could do without it
I got those
Treat your kids bad
Don't you talk back 
Gone ballistic
Unrealistic 
Awful, lowdown 
Bitch to be around 
PMS Blues
*cries* 
Oh, what are you looking at
Blues..
