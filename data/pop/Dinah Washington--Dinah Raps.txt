I'm not late
Just in time for primetime
Just another sign
That it's magic when I rhyme
Higher I climb
Went from too much spare time
To fine dining
Knives shining
Class like Dinah
Washington wine
Time to dine
On the flesh of our enemies
That's the house specialty
The wait: it's killing me
You gotta be kidding me
All this grown-up talk
Is killing the kid in me
Primetime
The game is on the line
Back to this rhyme
While sippin lemon lime
Damn she fine
Got spice, sage
Rosemary, thyme
And in her eyes
It's sublime
Just wish she was mine...

[Hook: SouthWest-DeAtH]

The night is young
What the hell you wanna do, huh?

The night is young
What the hell you wanna do, huh?

The night is young
What the hell you wanna do, huh?

[Verse 2: SouthWest-DeAtH]

This beat is sick
She's thick quick
This is Common's Slick Rick
But it's No I.D
We'd all agree
This is better than on See
Me Now I.D. on the beat
How Ye put Uncle Charlie
On his feet
There goes the bed sheets
What more can I say
About See Me Now
I said do it yourself
Still you're asking how
I wish they say aloha
Instead of saying ciao
I come in, say goodbye
Portuguese in Macao
In German
Instead of Missus it's Frau
No I never met Mao
No I'm not Tao
German shepherds
And not a chow chow
Fly to Shanghai
And they all kowtow
In case you don't know
That means bow down

[Hook: SouthWest-DeAtH]

Primetime, basking in the lime
Didn't steal a line
This a remix
Ye's a genius
Can't you feel it

Primetime

Primetime
