Someday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe he'll come sunday
Maybe monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure he'll come one day
Maybe tuesday will be
My good news day

We'll built a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Oh, what would you
And so all else above
I'm dreaming of the man I love
