[Verse 1]
Oh I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
Who is sailing all over the sea
And I'm thinking tonight of him only
And I wonder does he ever think of me

[Verse 2]
Could been better for us both had we never
In this wide wicked world had never met
For the pain and the pleasures he's brought me
I am sure I will never forget

[Bridge]
So I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes

[Verse 3]
Oh you told me once dear that you love me
And you swore that we never would part
But a linking the chain has been broken
Leaving me with a sad broken heart

[Outro]
Yes I'm thinking tonight of my blues eyes
And I wonder does he ever think of me
