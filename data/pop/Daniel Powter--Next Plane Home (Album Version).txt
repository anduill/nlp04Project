I woke up early to baby blue eyes from the? Whoah whoah
And when the sun comes through and lights you like the angel you are whoah whoah
I know I do you wrong when I'm with you I've been gone

With every season change, it looks the same? Whoah whoah
And don't these empty streets skip a beat the flowers don't bloom whoah whoah

I can't believe I missed your birthday again
And I wanna come back but I just don't know when now

And I'm so lonely your not here with me
That's way I'm gonna be on the next plane home
The road that never ends next ends around the bend I see your smile whoah whoah
I'd swim across the sea to be with you for a while whoah whoah
Cos I'm? Life?
Now the way that I feel I just don't belong

And I'm so lonely you're not here with me
That's why I'm gonna be on the next plane home
And you're you're the only face I wanna see
That's why I'm gonna be on the next plane home

Stand around try to make every moment
And be somebody yeah anybody
It seems the whole world is taking me over
I need somebody to help me get back??

And I've always been a million miles away
But things are gonna change
I just wanna come home

And you're you're the only face I wanna see
That's why I gonna be on the next plane home
Yeah I'm taking the next plane home
Now I'm getting the next plane home
Now I'm taking the next plane home
