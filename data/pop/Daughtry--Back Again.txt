[Verse 1]
The truth behind every thing
Behind every one lies somewhere
I'm taking it slowly and seems like you don't care
About little things that mean so much
You leave me alone while you're losing touch
And everywhere I go it isn't clear
I can't breathe

[Chorus]
Because I hate it when
The fear sets in
And I wonder when, you'll be back again

[Verse 2]
It's like we said a while ago, yeah
You switch the shoes you still won't change you
Pretend that you know me
But you're so unaware

[Chorus]
And I hate it when
The fear sets in
And I wonder when, you'll be back again
I remember when the fall began
And I wonder if you'll be the same again

[Verse 3]
We've all been down this road before
I give it all, you wanted more
I've only got myself to blame

[Chorus]
And I hate it when, the fear sets in
And I wonder when you'll be back again
And I hate it when, the fear sets in
And I wonder when you'll be back again
I remember when the fall began
And I wonder if you'll feel the same again

[Verse 4]
We've all been down this road before
I give it all, you wanted more
I've only got myself to blame

[Chorus]
And I hate it when, the fear sets in
(We've all been down this road before
And I wonder when you'll be back again
(I give it all, you wanted more
(I've only got myself to blame
