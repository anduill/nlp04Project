Wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin' 
Plannin' and dreamin' each night of his charms
That won't get you into his arms 

So if you're lookin' to find love, you can share 
All you gotta do is 
Hold him and kiss him and love him
And show him that you care

Show him that you care just for him
Do the things he likes to do 
Wear your hair just for him
'Cau-au-ause, you won't get him
Thinkin' and a-prayin' 
Wishin' and a-hopin' 

'Cause wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin' 
Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will star-art 
That won't get you into his heart 

So if you're thinkin' how great true love is
All you gotta do is 
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love
Yeah, just do it, and after you do, you will be his

You gotta show him that you care just for him
And do the things that he likes to do 
Wear your hair just for him
'Cau-au-ause, you won't get him
Thinkin' and a-prayin' 
Wishin' and a-hopin' 

'Cause wishin' and hopin' and thinkin' and prayin' 
Plannin' and dreamin' his kisses will start 
That won't get you into his heart 

So if you're thinkin' how great true love-ove is
All you gotta do is 
Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love
Yeah, just do it, and after you do, you will be his
You will be hi-is
You will be hi-i-is
