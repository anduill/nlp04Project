I've got a plan to make me rich and famous,
Lucky for me, for you it's a bitch you ain't in,
My plans are slowly changing,
Fame is so contagious<a href="http://www.testimania.com/">Testi Canzoni</a>

Chorus
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular

I must confess,
I've been a ve-ry bad boy,
Been sleepin around,
Talk of the town,
My name is
Hol-lywood will beckon,
E-veryone will listen,
Play my video hear me on the radio,
Dancin to the disco no one ever says no

Chorus
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular,
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular

My friends are all in Limousines
My friends are all celebrity
I Just Sold My Soul

Play my video hear me on the radio,
Dancin to the disco no one ever says no

I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular,
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular

My friends are all celebrity
My friends are all in Limousines

{ Play my video hear me on the radio,}
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
{Dancin to the disco, no one ever says no}
I wanna be pop-ular,
{ Play my video hear me on the radio,}
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
{Dancin to the disco, no one ever says no}
I wanna be popular,

Are you willing to sleep your way to the top?
Do you want to be popular?
