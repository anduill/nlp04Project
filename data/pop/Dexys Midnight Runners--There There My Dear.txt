Dear Robin
Hope you don't mind me writing,
There's more than one thing I need to ask you.
(Yes, yes, yes) [if ]you're so anti-fashion,
[why] Not wear flares, instead of dressing down all the same.

Its just that looking like that I can express my dissat[isfaction].
Robin let me explain, though you'd never see in a million years.
Keep quoting Cabaret, Berlin, Burroughs, J.G. Ballard, Duchamp, Beauvoir,
Kerouac, Kierkegaard, Michael Rennie.
And I don't believe you really like Frank Sinatra.

Robin you're always so happy, how the hell?
You're like a dumb dumb patriot.
If you're supposed to be so angry, why not fight?
Let me benefit from your right.

You know the only way to change things
Is to shoot men who arrange things,
Robin, I would explain but you'd never see in a million years.
Well, you've made your rules, but we don't know that game,
But I'd listen to your records, but your logic's far too lame
I'd only waste three valuable minutes of my life
With your insincere.

You see Robin, Im just searching for the young soul rebels, and I cant
find them anywhere. Where have you hidden them?

Maybe you should welcome the new soul vision.
