Poor old Jonny Ray
Sounded sad upon the radio
He moved a million hearts in mono
Out mothers moved sing along, who would blame them
Now you're grown (so grown up) 
So grown (so grown up) now I must say more than ever
Toora loora torra loo rye aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen, Oh I swear (what he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
With you in that dress, oh my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah come on Eileen

These people 'round here
With their beat down eyes sunk in smoke dried faces
They're resigned to what their fate is
But not us, (no never) no not us (no never)
We are far to young and clever
Come on Eileen
Toora loora toora loo rye aye
I've been on this toon forever

Come on Eileen well I swear (what he means)
Ah come on lets take off everything
That pretty red dress, oh Eileen (tell him yes)
Ah come on lets, ah come on Eileen

Come on Eileen toora ta loo rye aye 
Come on Eleen toora ta loo rye aye
Torra torra ta loo rye
Oh Eileen
I said come on Eileen 
Oh come on Eileen 
We are far to young and clever, and things wont ever change
I said
Toora loora toora loo rye aye 

Sung in backround
Come on Eileen toora ta loo rye aye 
Come on Eleen toora ta loo rye aye
Torra torra ta loo rye

Come on Eileen oh I swear (what he means)
At this moment you mean everything to me
Oh to me, Oh Eileen
You mean everything
