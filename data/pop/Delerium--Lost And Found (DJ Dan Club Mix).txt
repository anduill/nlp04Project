i really wanted to go 
it hurt me too much to stay 
I run away so fast 
that my heart couldn't find the way 
then you came along 
and I was tired of my sadness 
it seemed as though my life went on 
but the feeling didn't last 

holding on to everything that's gone 
saving my life from going on 
thinking of what else I could have done 
it wasn't meant to be 
(and then you came along and I was lost and found 
my life went on but I was lost and found) 
I was lost and found 

I was back on my feet 
you could say I was barely walking 
but the cut was deep 
and I was holding on to the past 

holding on to everything that's gone 
saving my life from going on 
thinking of what else I could have done 
it wasn't meant to be 
(and then you came along and I was lost and found 
my life went on but I was lost and found) 
I was lost and found 

he had taken my illusions 
and I needed them so badly 
I grew tired of my confusion 
cause he was still there 
everywhere 

you came along and I was lost and found (lost and found) 
my life went on but I was lost and found 
you came along and I was stuck in the past 
there was a new life in sight 
but I was blind... 

holding on to everything that's gone 
saving my life from going on 
thinking of what else I could have done 
it wasn't meant to be 
(and then you came along and I was lost and found 
my life went on but I was lost and found) 
there was a new lief in sight 
but I was blind
