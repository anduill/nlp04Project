Jealous of the world again
Dont even try to be my friend
Everything is wrong for me
And everything's right for them
Jealous of the world again
I represent the worst in man
Jealous of the world again

I'd like to interrupt you
Fuck you to everything you say
It's nothing personal, mind you
But either you or I should go away
So go away

Jealous of the world again
Don't even try to be my friend
Everything is wrong for me
And everything's right for them
Jealous of the world again
Don't give a shit about your deadly sin
Jealous of the world again

You belong to a useless subset
The one that's not me
Don't try to define my problems
Or understand me
I'll trip you up, I'll flip you off
Pardon me
Don't wanna hear your voice
I think I'll fart on your face

And there's nothing you can do
And there's nothing I can do
I'll just stay away from you

I'd like to make a comment
Roll down the window and scream
I hate you 'cause I hate me
I gotta shake this disease
