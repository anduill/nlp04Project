V1 (Beyonce'):
Its over and done
But the heart ache lives on inside
And who is the one clinging to
Instead of me tonight

Hook:
And where are you now?
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Where ever you go, go
Cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me fall apart

Chorus:
In the words of a broken heart its just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darlin'
Don't you know there's no (no body left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know there's no (nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight,goodnight)

V2 (Kelly):
I'm there at your side
Apart of all the things you are
But you gotta find some one else
You gotta go find your shinning star

Hook:
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Where ever you go, go
Cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You'll never see me all apart

Chorus:
In the words of a broken heart its just emotions taking me over
Caught up in sorrow
Lost in the song
But if you don't come back
Come home to me darlin'
Don't you know there's no (no body left in this world to hold me tight)
And don't you know there's no (nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight)
Kiss goodnight
(Goodnight,goodnight)

(The last girl does chorus)
