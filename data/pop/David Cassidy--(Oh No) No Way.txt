You are my morning sunshine
You keep my mind from sleepin' all day
Thank you for the love you gave me
That was all it took to save me
The cloud my life was under
Brought only rain and thunder my way, baby
Darkness was the room I once knew
But that was long before I met you

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way

How could I ever leave her
She's made a true believer out of me, baby
I can hardly wait 'til night time
But any time with you's the right time

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way

Somebody said that I might lose my head
If I touched you
So I tried it
And now I find you're still on my mind
I can't resist you
I can't hide it
I can't hide it
I can't hide it, hide it, hide it
Oh no

Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no
There's no way
