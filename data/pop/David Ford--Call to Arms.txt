This is a call to arms, hold your darling tight
And don’t let her go with the fork in the road
This is a call to arms, this is a call to arms…

Let us not be defeated, even though we can’t win
‘Cause I see there’s a crack in the walls of the mess that we’re in
And let us not be divided, I cannot make it alone
But I’ve got a heart full of somebody calling me home
And she says:

This is a call to arms, hold your darling tight
And don’t let her go with the fork in the road
This is a call to arms, this is a call to arms…

I’ve never been one for fighting,
Yeah, but I’m not about to lay down
‘Cause I still have my face (faith?) in the dust of this dirty old town
And I wouldn’t have it all easy, so come on, let the hard times begin
And let’s kick through the crack of the walls of the mess that we’re in
And I say:

This is a call to arms, hold your darling tight
And don’t let her go with the fork in the road
This is a call to arms, this is a call to arms…

Do you remember old Danny?
It’s been so long since he died
Well, he was just a man who loved one woman for all of his life
And under hospital blankets, family stood round his bed,
He was too weak to talk, but he lifted his eyes and they said:

“Darling, be strong; even though I’ll be gone
Still I want you to know your love has meant everything,
Now pick up your voice and sing ‘cause:

This is a call to arms, hold your darling tight
And don’t let her go with the fork in the road
This is a call to arms, this is a call to arms…”

Well this is a call to arms, hold your darling tight
And don’t let her go with the fork in the road
Well this is a call to arms, yeah now this is a call to arms
This is a call to arms, this is a call to arms…
