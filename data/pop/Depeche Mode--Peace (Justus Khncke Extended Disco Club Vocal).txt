Peace

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I’m leaving bitterness
Behind this time
I’m cleaning out my mind
There is no space
For the regrets
I will remember to forget

Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies
At which I vibrate
I’m going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me

I’m leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows
That it cast
There is a radar in my heart
I should have trusted
From the start

Just look at me
I’m a living act of holiness
Giving all the positivity
That I possess
I’m going to light up the world

Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It’s meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It’s an inevitability
