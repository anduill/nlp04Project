I'm sorry for upsetting the apple cart
But the news is bad on easy streeet
You and i have drift apart
And it's never gonna be the same

Tell your brother and your sister ray
That i probably won't be round again
But i'd always give them the time of day
Tho it's never gonna be the same

Once there was an angel
An angel and some friends (who)
Flew around from song to soul
Making up the ends

People nowadays don't need them
(they don't need them)
People nowadays they need people to blame
Yeah

Once there was an angel
An angel and some friends (who)
Flew around from song to soul
Making up the ends

People nowadays don't need them
(they don't need them)
People nowadays they need people to blame
They need, people to blame
Yeah
People nowadays they need people to blame

Once a china cup is cracked
It can be made to look new again
And it may for ever stay intact
But it's never gonna be the same

No it's never gonna be the, same
Do do do dodo do do
It's never gonna be the same
