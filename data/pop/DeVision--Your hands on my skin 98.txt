only you know my perverted dreams
you know what I feel
you know what I really want
you are the only one
I could prefer to touch you now
But I only want to know
one thig at this point

Please tell me 
Why i belong to you
And when I cry,when I cry
For your hands on my skin

Save the only thing you can..
Tell me wht is this
Don't try to hide the perfect mess
Of your strange behavior..
