And though you try to
Justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door you're not
Deceiving me
Well, I'd have thought that
You'd have known much better
Sending 'round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much
Better now.

Is it just that you
Can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say
Goodbye
How would you feel here
In my place.

And now I know my love
Is lost on you
And nothing you can say or do 
Will turn my head around
I'd have thought you'd
Have decency
To come and tell the truth to me
Instead of telling lies
Your eyes betray.

Is it just that you
Can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say
Goodbye
How would you feel here
In my place.
Tell me to my face
You're leaving now.
Tell me to my face
You're leaving now.
