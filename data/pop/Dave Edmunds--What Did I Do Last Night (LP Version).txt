I can feel you slipping away from me
A little bit further now every day
I'm holding on but I can't believe
This is how you want it to be

Oh, you're slipping away
Oh, you're slipping away

It feels like walking down a long, dark road
You never talk to me the way you did before
You ride through the city with your head held high
And all I can do is watch you go by

Oh, you're slipping away
Oh, you're slipping away

I'm gonna give it all I've got to give
I've got to hold on, see what tomorrow brings
You're slipping away, but give me one more try
One more chance to wipe these tears from my eyes

You're slipping away
Oh, you're slipping away
