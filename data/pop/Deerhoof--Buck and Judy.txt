Buck and Judy tasty, isn't it? this fruit
Buck and Judy big, isn't it? that fruit
Buck and Judy asking name of the fruit

No one knows what
No one had seen that

Dust falls onto earth, down
Finding how to rise, sighs ahhhh

Buck and Judy commenting on the fruit

Buck and Judy tasty, isn't it? this fruit
Buck and Judy big, isn't it? that fruit
Buck and Judy what was that? that fruit
