Hammering away like he's fucking, Tommy Noble.

Thinks he's got it going bossa nova. No way. 
What is this garbage? What is this?

Lighthouses rule. You don't like the lighthouse? You suck. What is this, the Seashorse Captain? The Seahorse Seashell Party? Who didn't invite me? 

Why didn't I get invited to the Seahorse Seahell. What is this? Get real. I'm in love with sea horses. I'm in love with them, they're so beautiful and cute, I'm in love with seahorses.

They're fucking unreal, I love them. They're like all the clocks. I love them. I love seashores, and I love looking at 'em, and I love seashells. I love seashell things. I love things with seashells and seahorses on 'em. 

Like blankets. 
And towels.
And little bags.
I love 'em.

Seahorses.
Forever.
