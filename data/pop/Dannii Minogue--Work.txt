Drivin' in my brand new benz 190, my home girl sheila
She's coolin' righ beside me, the young girlies get upset
Because they can't keep their boys in check
Relax 'cause that's not where my head is at

I don't need guys like these, turn up the music
And I'll show you how to do a jam
(Ow) I get busy (oh) (good and plenty)
(Oh) I'm just here to work your body
(Work) I ain't with it (yeah) don't you get it
(Ow) I'm just here to work your body

Work work work your body (get up)
Work work work your body (get up)
Work work work your body, work your body

It's about seven o'clock, when my service comes on
It's my manager saying, dannii (pick up the phone)
Don't forget the sound check, you have an interview next
Jumped in my limousine, popped in my album cassette (aw)
Then I stepped (oh yeah) on the stage (oh) turn up the music

And I'll show you how to do a jam
(Work) I get busy (work) good and plenty
(Work) I'm just here to work your body
(Oh yeah work) (work) don't you get it
(Work) I ain't with it (work)I'm just here to work your body
(Work work work your body) work your body

(Work work work your body) work your body
(Work work work your body) work your body

'Cause that's just my style, mmm (get up get up get up)
