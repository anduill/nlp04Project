It's been so long since I had a smile
I've stayed sad for such a long while

If you can cheer me up
I could learn to love you

You kiss me now and I turn away
I think I'm still kissing yesterday

Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can
make me happy
Cheer me up

I don't want to spend the rest of my days
dreaming yesterday's daydreams
Out with the bad and in with the good
You feel my heart girl, you're knocking on wood

So generous, I'm being kind
With selfishness in the back of my mind

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
giving yesterday's promises

No more giving my mind away

Tomorrow's love will be yesterday

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
living yesterday

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
singing yesterday's love songs
