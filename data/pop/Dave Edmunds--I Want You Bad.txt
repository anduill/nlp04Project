Lately it's been drivin' me mad
‘Cause you're the best thing that I've ever had 
And I want you , oh, I want you bad.

So come on lets give it a whirl.
And we can shake up the whole wide world 
Yeah, I want you, I want you, girl.

I'm all run out of things to do
And I've got no other place but you.

Never, no you'll never be sad
I'm gonna make you feel so glad 
And I want you, oh, I want you bad.

I'm all run out of things to do
I've got no other place but you.

Thinking, I'm gonna losing my head
You know the phone line is takin' too much bread
And I want you, oh, I want you had.

Lately it's been drivin' me mad
‘Cause you're the best thing that I've ever had 
And I want you , oh, I want you bad
I want you , oh, I want you bad.
