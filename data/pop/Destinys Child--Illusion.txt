[Lauryn]
Went from a dream to the young supreme

[Destiny's Child]
Hey, yeah
Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
Illusion

[Lauryn]
1 - Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go

[Destiny's Child]
Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling get you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Illusion

Repeat 1

Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone
Illusion

Repeat 1

[Pras]
Yeah, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
I don't write love songs, leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live, you don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss, hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin' candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
Cuz we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

[Lauryn]
Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
(Hey, yo, I love you shorty)
You talkin' all that jazz

Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the Lotto
Use and abusin' so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

[Destiny's Child]
Oh, oh
It's just an illusion

Repeat 1

[Wyclef]
Another one from Wyclef
Another one from Jerry "Wonder"
Another one from Thirty Cash
Dance I say, dance I say, ha ha
(Confusion)
Refugee Camp
(Illusion, you get in)
Destiny Child
(Me again)
We out

[Destiny's Child]
Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in a world, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

[Lauryn]
Went from a dream to the young supreme
Went from a dream to the young supreme
