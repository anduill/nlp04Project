SOMEWHERE INSIDE MY EVOLUTION KARMICALLY I SEEK RETROBUTION 
LOOKING FOR LOVE IN PHYSICAL BEAUTY 
DESIRE IS THE DRUG OF THE BORGOISE 
AND NOW I TRY TO INTELLECTUALIZE 
LIKE A GLIMMER OF GOOD IN A BAD MAN'S EYES 
I AM CONSUMED BY THE FLESH HAUNTING ME 
I KNOW TEMPTATION TAUNTS THE EMPTY 
SO POUR YOURSELF OVER ME 
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SEE 
BECAUSE I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE IN THE DARK 
AND I LIKE THE TENSION THE TENSION AND THE SPARK 

THE DECADENCE OF GIVING IN TO DESIRE 
CREATES SUCH EMPATHY WITHIN 
LOOKING FOR LOVE IN SPIRITUAL FACES 
BLIND TO THE ART OF FABRICATION 
I'M LIKE A BABY SUCKING MAMMA'S MILK 
WANNA DRINK MY FILL AND THEN SOME 
LEAVE ME ALONE 
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS BETTER THAN THIS 
BUT TEMPTATION TEMPTS THE TEMPTEE 
SO POUR YOURSELF OVER ME 
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SEE 
BECAUSE I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE IN THE DARK 
AND I LIKE THE TENSION 
THE TENSION AND THE SPARK 

THIS PHYSICALITY 
SHIFTING ME CHEMICALLY 
SUCH POWER OVER ME 
Its JUST DESIRE 
I KNOW Its TRICKERY 
I KNOW Its JUST SKIN DEEP 
I KNOW I SHOULD RESIST 
I'M JUST TOO TIRED 
TOO TIRED 

THERE'S JUST ONE THING MISSING 
ONE THING MISSING HERE IS LOVE 

I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE IN THE DARK 
I LIKE THE TENSION THE TENSION AND THE SPARK 

SO POUR YOURSELF OVER ME 
UNTIL THERE' S NOTHING LEFT TO SEE 
THERE'S JUST ONE THING MISSING 
THE ONE THING MISSING HERE IS LOVE
