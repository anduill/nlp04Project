Oh, I won't back down

No, I won't back down

You can stand me up at the gates of hell

But I won't back down

No, I won't back down

Won't be turned around

In a world that keeps pushing me around

Gonna stand my ground

And I won't back down

I won't back down, baby

There ain't no easy way out

I will stand my ground

And I won't back down

Cause I know what's right

I've got just one life

In a world that keeps dragging me down

Gonna stand my ground

And I won't back down

Hey, baby

There ain't no easy way out

Hey, ah, I will stand my ground

And I won't back down

No, I won't back down
