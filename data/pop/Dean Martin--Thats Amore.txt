(In Napoli where love is King) 
(When boy meets girl) 
(Here's what they say)

When the moon hits your eye 
Like a big-a pizza pie
That's amore
When the world seems to shine 
Like you've had too much wine
That's amore

Bells'll ring
Ting-a-ling-a-ling 
Ting-a-ling-a-ling
And you'll sing "Vita bella"
Hearts'll play 
Tippi-tippi-tay 
Tippi-tippi-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool 
Joost-a like pasta fazool
That's amore
When you dance down the street 
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream 
But you know you're not dreamin', signore
'Scusami, but you see 
Back in old Napoli, that's amore

(When the moon hits your eye) 
(Like a big-a pizza pie, that's amore)

That's amore

(When the world seems to shine 
(Like you've had too much wine, that's amore)

That's amore

(Bells will ring)
(Ting-a-ling-a-ling)
(ting-a-ling-a-ling)
(And you'll sing "Vita bella")
(Vita bell-vita bella)
(Hearts will play)
(Tippi-tippi-tay, tippi-tippi-tay)
(Like a gay tarantella)

Lucky fella

When the stars make you drool just like pasta fazool
That's amore (that's amore)
When you dance down the street 
With a cloud at your feet, you're in love
When you walk in a dream 
But you know you're not dreaming, signore
'Scusami, but you see 
Back in old Napoli, that's amore
