Everyone else...
Are we some kind of lovers
Everyone else...
What you're doing with me
I know this is not what they want
They're afraid you've been minding
And I already know, how it's going to be

If anyone should ask
Secret mated
As long as this life last
We are mated
Why else would I be here, right now
And you know we'll still be here tomorrow

Nobody else
Understands what I'm doing
Nobody else
No one makes me act in this way

And because we can't comprehend, what we mean to eachother
They won't leave you alone
So you know what to say

If anyone should ask
Secret mated
As long as this life last
We are mated
Why else would I be here right now
And you know you''ll still be here tomorrow

I hold you in my heart
We are mated
A very special part
We are mated
Why else would I be here right now
And you know I''ll still be here tomorrow

I see things far ahead
Maybe beautiful children
I don't have words I'm thinking of
But it's way beyond fore .... for love

If anyone should ask
We are mated
Why else would I be here right now
and you know you'll still be here tomorrow

I hold you in my heart
Secret mated
in a very special part
we are mated
Why else would I be here right now right now right now
And you know we''ll still be here tomorrow

ohohohoh
secret mated
for as long as this life last
we are mated
Why else would I be here right now 
and you know you'll still be here tomorrow
