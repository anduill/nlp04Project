Soft things
You want soft things
You need soft things
You'll get soft things

You register emotion
You get a full hit
There's a certain way it shivers
When she shakes

Her mind seemed so chaotic
Her posture was erotic
And her voice was exotic
I acted so neurotic
I thought it idiotic
Her dance was so technotic
She became hypnotic

And now I'm calling out for soft things
Something soft sometimes get hard
Now I'm calling out for soft things
When something calls you
You'll know what to do

Soft things
You want soft things
You need soft things
You'll get soft things

You find a longer wave length
You hear a deeper note
It's a buried treasure
That she doesn't hide

Her mind seemed so chaotic
Her posture was erotic
And her voice was exotic
I acted so neurotic
I thought it idiotic
Her dance was so technotic
She became hypnotic

Soft things
You want soft things
You need soft things
You'll get soft things
(repeat)
