thank the days for our dreams
thank the days
(4x)

there are a thousand different ways
we must try to hear each other say
no matter how different, it's still the same
we all feel love and pain

slip off your views, unbutton your mind
stay a while, 1000 miles
light a candle to your soul
deja vu 1000 miles old

thank the days for our dreams
thank the days
(4x)

close the door and lock the time
jump over the wall on the other side
come on in, the dreams are fine
now I know why I like this place

thank the days for our dreams
thank the days
(4x)

I pull the covers over my head
black velvet darkness above my bed
it's beyond what I've seen or read
now I know why I thank the days
