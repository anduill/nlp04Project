Charlie do you shiver
when you wake up in the middle of the night
do you get down on your knees and pray
to a god, you never believe in
that I'm all right

'Cause I do Charlie
why don't you, call me
tell me Charlie
why don't you score me
a letter and set me free

Forgive me when I say
I did my best in every way
to understand you
believe me when I say
I did my best in every way
to make you strong

Charlie boy

It wasn't ever easy
to be sodom and gomorrah all around
ooh ooh
it wasn't ever easy
to say sorry or admit when I was wrong

But pull on his heart Charlie
why don't you call me
tell me Charlie
why don't you score me
a letter and set me free

set me free

Charlie boy, when you can lock me away
in a room for a million years
Charlie boy, then could I see you Charlie
tell me
Charlies boy, when you can lock me up or down
in my own tears
but loving

Free me Charlie
(when you can lock me away
in a room for a million years)
why don't you call me
(when can I see you Charlie)
tell me Charlie
(when you can lock me up a)
why don't you score me
a letter and free me
Charlie, why don't you call me
tell me Charlie
why don't you score me
a letter and free me
Charlie
