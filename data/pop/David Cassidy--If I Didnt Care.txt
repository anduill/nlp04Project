If I didn't care more than words can say 

If I didn't care would I feel this way? 
If this isn't love 
then why do I thrill? 
And what makes my head go round an' round 

While my heart stays still? 
If I didn't care 
would it be the same? 
Would my ev'ry pray'r begin and end 
When I speak your name? 
And would I be sure that this is love 
Beyond compare? 
Would all this be true 
If I didn't care for you? 

If I didn't care more than words can say
