[Verse 1]
My days are as dark as my nights
And I see no sunshine in sight
Your memory keeps blocking my view
And I'm living on memories of you

[Chorus]
Can't eat when I'm hungry
Can't sleep when I'm tired
And all of these tears
Can't put out this fire
Your memory just won't turn me loose
And I'm living on memories of you

[Verse 2]
There's just no forgetting about you
How long can I survive without you
I just can't believe that we're through
And I'm living on memories of you

[Chorus]
