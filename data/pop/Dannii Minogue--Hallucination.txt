Mmm ah 
Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 

My inner world of fantasy 
Opens up for all to see 
Dreaming of you here with me 
Eyes and hands engulfing me 

Inhibitions leaving us 
Expressing powers lead by lust 
Watch me wait if you can stand it 
Try my taste, too much to handle 

Body, mind combine as one 
Unified, we've just begun 
Wrapped up in the world of love 
Forgetting all despair 

Communication, concentration 
Touching worlds, hallucination 
Take me now to somewhere new 
Anywhere, to be with you 

Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 
Love me, hold me 
Love me 

Multitude of mysteries 
Unfold before your eyes 
Pledge yourself to secrecy 
Cover up the lies 

Fearless in your passion 
Thoughtless of your fear 
Safely hide it all inside 
Confusion getting clear
