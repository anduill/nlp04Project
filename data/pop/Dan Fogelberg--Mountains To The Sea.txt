Well, I spent two days in traveling
The mountains to the sea
I knew the change would do me good
And set my spirit free
I spent two night in wondering
What it is you've done to me
Before an answer came I reached the sea

Here I spent my days in wandering
The reaches and the reefs
And my soul becomes so quiet
I can hear my own beliefs
I sail out on the ocean
'Til I cannot see the land
And I wonder if you'll ever understand

Why a soul with so much heaven held
Should ever feel so damned
Why it's always so uncomfortable
To hold anothers hand
Why of late I feel myself a ship
Out to sea unmanned
I wonder if you'll ever understand

There are seagulls in the morning here
I watch them search and soar
As they dive to take the fishes that swim 
Just beyond the shore
Then they fly off in the distance
'Til they finally fade from view
Somehow they remind me so of you

There's so many things you need to learn
That I can never teach
And places in your troubled soul
That I may never reach
So I wander like an ebbing tide
Along this lonely beach
And cast my dreams like stones into the sea
