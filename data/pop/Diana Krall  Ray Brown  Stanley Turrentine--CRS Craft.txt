Never trust the stars
When you're about to fall in love
Look for hidden signs before you start to sigh

Never trust the moon
When you're about to taste his kiss
He knows all the lines and he knows how to lie

Just wait for a night
When the skies are all bare and then
If you still care

Never trust your dreams
When you're about to fall in love
For you're dreams may quickly fall apart

So if you're smart
Really smart
Only trust your heart
