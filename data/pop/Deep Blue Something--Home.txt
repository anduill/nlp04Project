[Verse 1]

If I woke up one morning with my memory gone
I'd pick out some clothes and I'd them on
And walk down the street and find a cafe
I'd order a Guinness and I'd sit there all day
Then some kids would come in and start a fuss
About how great their weekend in New Orleans was
Then I'd look down and smile like their tale was my own
I'd be drowning in memory and then I would know
How it used to be in summers many years ago
When we really didn't worry or care to know
Where we would be or how old we had grown
Then I'd open my eyes and I'd know I was open

[Hook]

Where my friends are, even when I'm not
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]

And then it would rain like it sometimes does
And if we were bored that wouldn't bother us
We'd just get in the car and drive through the night
And get lost in East Texas but no one would mine
Because we'd find our way home like we always do
Funny how the time flies in our youth
But with darkness approaching we will all grow close
In the place we call heaven
BUt for now we'll just call it home

[Hook]

I'll see you at home
