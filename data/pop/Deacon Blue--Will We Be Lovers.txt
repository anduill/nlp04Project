When you were young and your heart was free
I'd run and meet you and rush to see
Just over the wall where the clouds roll by
And age and chance and tears were far away

Oh if heaven wouldn't see
Light lovers so distantly
Then look today at this love so free
When you are young again

When you were young and your eyes are old
Then all your treasures my hand can stroke
And all your memories and your sorrows are loosed
And blown and left so your lips may be touched

Oh if heaven wouldn't see
Light lovers so distantly
Then look today at this love so free
When you are young again
