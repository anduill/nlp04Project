Two men doubt through bars

One saw mud, the other stars

I think with eyes like ours, there are stars and mud

And what the lover do

But fix his down-cast eyes on you

Wanting to fix you too

And show you how to sing



Maybe there's nothing more

To feeling than getting sore

But I'm willing to hurt you more

To show you what I need



What I need, I mean, do I need to be meaning to you as something to destroy

Or so it seems, your dreams something screams

Something dumb, and cursory-like jewel



Two men doubt through bars

One saw mud, the other stars

I think with eyes like ours, there are stars
