Mercy mercy mercy
And I saw you under the disco lights
And I saw you poised in your disco stance
And I saw you out on the disco floor
And I saw you move to your disco dance
Going Left Right, Left Right, Left Right, Left Right
Left Right, Left Right, Left Right, Left Right...
And I saw you up at the disco bar
And I saw you leaving the disco zone
And I saw you move in for the disco kill
And I saw you leave the disco on your own
Going Left Right, Left Right, Left Right, Left Right
Left Right Left Right, Left Right, Left Right...
And I saw you dressed in your army greens
And I saw you marching with the army losers
And I saw you at ease in the army ranks
Out of the army out on manoeuvres
Going Left Right, Left Right, Left Right, Left Right
Left Right, Left Right, Left Right, Left Right.....
