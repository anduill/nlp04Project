It's the last night on earth
Before the great divide
My hands are shaking time was
Never on our side

There's no such thing
As a beautiful goodbye
As an ordinary day
I prayed for you a thousand times

It's never enough
No matter how many times 
I try to tell you this is love

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like
It's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth

A penny for your thoughts
A picture so it'll last
That cycle down the roads of immortality
Your fingers on my skin
Only you can hear my fear
Only you can help me heal
I see forever with you here

It's never enough
No matter how many miles stand between us
This is love

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
And if tomorrow falls asleep
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like
It's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth

It's never enough, no
It's never enough
It's never enough

The afterglow
And the bright sunlight
The shadows fall
Will you still be mine?
Will you still be mine?
Will you still be mine?
I ask

If tomorrow never comes
I want you to know right now that I
I'm gonna love you until the day I die
(And if tomorrow falls asleep)
'Til the day I die
Can you hold me first
I'm gonna love you like
It's the last night on earth
Like it's the last night on earth
It's the last night on earth
It's never enough
