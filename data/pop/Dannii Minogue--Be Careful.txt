You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 

Are you dreaming, I can see it in your eyes 
Something tells me, you're about to say goodbye 
And I wonder, are you tired of my touch 
Once you held me now it doesn't mean as much 
You don't love me like you used to love me baby 
Body, soul and mind, hey hey hey 
Before you go, throw it all away, take some advice 

You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
Good love is hard to find, I ain't lying 
You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
'Cause if you lose my love you'll be crying 

If you go look before you leap, here's a reason 
Love don't grow on trees, just remember 
When I'm slipping through your hands it won't be easy 
To bring me back again 
In a world filled with every known temptation 
You can pay the price, hey hey hey 
Before you go, throw it all away, take some advice 

You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
Good love is hard to find, I ain't lying 
You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
'Cause if you lose my love you'll be crying 

You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
Good love is hard to find, I ain't lying 
You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
'Cause if you lose my love you'll be crying 

Oh just think about it

You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
Good love is hard to find, I ain't lying 
You better be nice, you better think twice, you better be careful 
'Cause if you lose my love you'll be crying 

Oh boy you better look before you leap 
Look before you leap
