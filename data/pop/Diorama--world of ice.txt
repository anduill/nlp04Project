So much further than you know 
Through a world of ice 
I have carved my way to you 
Pushed and pulled by these lies 
These lies 
These lies 

So much further than you know 
Through a world of ice 
I have carved my way to you 
Pushed and pulled by these lies 
These lies 
These lies 

Only to stay closer now, 
come and lick my wounds 
drink these tears I saved for you 
perished like the Grim's appeased 
but I'm so scared inside 
see the hangman missing one more line 

Through this world of ice 
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you 
I'm here without you 
Distance to decide from which I cherish you 
Out of fear 
Out of fear 
Out of fear 

can you tell what's right from wrong 
would the trouble end 
meld the masses in return 
light the beacon just for me, so I might find you there 
send the senseless signal out of here 

Through this world of ice 
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you 
I'm here without you 
Distance to decide from which I cherish you 
Out of fear 
Out of fear 

Through this world of ice 
I call your name again 'cause I'm here without you 
I'm here without you 
Distance to decide from which I cherish you 
Out of fear 
Out of fear...
