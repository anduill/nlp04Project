I believe in the power of love
I believe
(repeat 3x)

And the people
Call me naïve

I believe
(repeat 4x)

What is it
That can make a lost soul found? Love.
And what is it
That can make the coldest day seem warm? Love.
And what is it
That can bring a smile through to a stranger?

I believe in the power of love
I believe
(repeat 2x)

Let them call me naïve.
I still believe.

Power of love
(repeat 4x)

What is it
That can make a lost soul found? Love.
And what is it
That can make the coldest day seem warm?
Love.
And what is it
That can bring a smile through to a stranger?

Give it everything
Cause what you give
You get so
give it everything
Open your heart.

I believe
(repeat out)
