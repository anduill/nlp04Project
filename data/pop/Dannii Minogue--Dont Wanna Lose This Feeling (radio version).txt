[Verse 1] 
I'm back for more, and i got the cure 
I know where i'm going for sure 
What we threw away, we should've saved 
Come and make my day 

[break] 
I said some things 
That did not ring true 
And i said some things i did not mean to 
Now i'm back for more (more) 

[chorus] 
'cos i don't wanna lose this feeling 
That you're givin' me everytime i need it 
Ain't lookin' for more 
I need what you're givin' me more, and more 
I don't wanna lose this feelin' 
That you're givin' me everytime i need it 
I ain't lookin' for more 
I nned what you're givin' me, more 
(give me more) 

[verse 2] 
Why can't we blow, why don't we go 
With our imperfections, we know 
What we threw away, we should've saved 
Come and make my day 

[break] 
I said some things 
That did not ring true 
And i said some things i did not mean 
Now i'm back for more (more) 

[repeat chorus] 

Don't wanna lose, don't, this feel 
Don't, don't wanna lose, don't, this feel 
Wanna lose, don't, this, this feel 
I'm ready, i'm ready, ready, ready, ready 

[outro] 
I'm ready, come get me 
And give me some more, give me some more 
I'm ready, come get get me 
And give some more 

[repeat chorus] 

Ooh i'm ready 
Oh give me some more 
Oh some more 
Yeah
