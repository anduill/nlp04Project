I don't want someone telling me what to do
I don't wanna find out my temper grew wings
And flew to you

Don't want somebody telling me what's not right
But I just want you to love me
Oh I just want you to love me

I don't wanna have to lie bout what's inside
When there's always been a tiny part of me
I'm trying to hide

I don't wanna see your expression when I let you down
And I just want you to love me
Oh I just want you to love me

There's a haiku poem inside of my head
But the words are written in invisible ink
Now the world is changing
I can barely keep up
What was hot is over
What was down is not
Now Adam and Eve are trying to split up
And I can't take anymore
'Cause I just want you to love me
Oh I just want you to love me

Love me
Oh I just want you to love me
