You throw a look, I catch a stare
You're checking me, up and down
Temptations in the air
Is it against the law, to wanna taste
A sexy boy, the heat is on
We're really steaming up this place

(BREAK)
I'm hypnotised by what could be boy
crawl and...

(CHORUS)
Creep up to me, take a deep drag on me
'till you're high, I'll make you feel so good inside
(lower, deeper, damn it's getting hot)
(harder, faster, don't you ever stop)
Yeah you creep up to me, like a shadow over me
Cast your spell, it feels so good inside
(further, movin', are you comin' up ?)
(higher, sweeter, don't you ever stop)

(VERSE 2)
Come on make a move
Don't resist
Don't tip toe round and round
You might as well dive in
I'ts like we're locked, and there's no key
I'ts a strange sensation
You really got a hold on me
