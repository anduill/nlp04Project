If your heart tells you so that you should leve me
Don't try to forget you and I never met
And before you'll fly one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words you once said.

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we shared no one can ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm willing
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart.

If my love for you can make you happy
Just open the door you won't see me anymore
And before you'll fly one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said.

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we shared no one can ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm willing
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart.

I'll keep on calling you sweetheart...
