Because I saw your face
A photograph I had misplaced
Now I'm stuck remembering
What can not be replaced

'Cause I spoke your name
I felt a sudden chill
'Cause I dream of you
I know I always will

I'm still in love
I can't let go
My heart's made up it's mind
A long, long time ago

I'm still in love
I haven't changed
After all I'm still in love

'Cause you were my friend
When no one seemed to care
Now I'm stuck remembering
Oh, I do wish that you were here

'Cause you knew my mind
Life will come apart
Because you showed me
I could make another start

I'm still in love
I haven't changed
After all I'm still in love

If there comes a time
And if you finally feel the way I do
Don't be afraid to call me
And tell me

I'm still in love
I can't let go
My heart's made up it's mind
Long, long time ago

I'm still in love
I will never change
After all I'm still in love
