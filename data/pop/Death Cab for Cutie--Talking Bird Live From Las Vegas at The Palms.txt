Oh, my talking bird
Though you know so few words
They're on infinite repeat
Like your brain can't keep up with your beak

And you're kept in an open cage
So you're free to leave or stay
Sometimes you get confused
Like there's a hint I am trying to give you

The longer you think, the less you know what to do

It's hard to see your way out
When you live in a house in a house
Cause you don't realize
That the windows were open the whole time

Oh, my talking bird
Though your feathers are tattered and furled
I'll love you all your days
Till the breath leaves your delicate face

It's all here for you as long as your choose to stay
It's all here for you as long as you don't fly away
