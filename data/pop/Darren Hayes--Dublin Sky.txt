I've been down a lonely street tonight
And I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me

But clouds cover up a Dublin sky
I don't know what's left of me
I don't know what's right with me

And I tried to keep my distance
And I've sung Amazing Grace
I've tarnished all our memories
But there'll always be a trace of you
Of you

I remember laughing on that river's edge
Trying to get you to jump with me
Trying to get you to fall for me

And your trembling heart it beats so fast
Holding hands you promised me
Holding hands we counted to three

And I felt your slipping fingers
And I saw you change your mind
If I hadn't dragged you in with me
You would have left me dive without you
Without you

Yeah they send you all the way from Hollywood
And maybe that Dublin sky was changing you
It put diamonds in your eyes
I always thought we were gonna make it through
But I wanted to hear it first from you

How many days am I gonna regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all those years
Held down by these tears
How many dreams have I left deserted?
How many hopes have been diverted?
Have I been buried in the dirt
Held down by this hurt
And how many lows did I let you highjack
How many ways can I study the playback
How did I end up lying here
Crying underneath a Dublin sky?
How many days am I gonna regret you?
How many nights till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all these years?
Drowning in my tears
How many nights am I gonna regret you?
How many days till I forget you?
Have I been wasting all these years
Drowning in my tears?
