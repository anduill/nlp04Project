Love me, my love
And say you're mine
Kiss me and hold me tight
Let's make the most of tonight

Tell me, my love
In words divine 
That we will never part
Stay very close to my heart

No sweeter bliss
No more than this
Could I ever know
Your tenderness, your sweet caress
How it thrills me so
Give me your love
Your heart and soul
Take me to heaven above
And say you love me, my love

(No sweeter bliss)
(No more than this)
Could I ever know
(Your tenderness, your sweet caress)
How it thrills me so
Give me your love
Your heart and soul
Take me to heaven above
And say you love me my love
Love me, my love
Love me, my love
