So I'll never feel your touch again
I'll get used to it
Hearts don't break they just bend
I'll come bouncing back
You barely left a scratch on me

You were nothing
But a little play thing
And your love bite
It was only a sting
Baby when you went
It hardly made a dent in me

It was just a fleshwound in my pride
It aint no tragedy that I can't survive

I'm lyin' to myself every night
Without you baby nothing's been right
No matter what I say
Can't make you go away
I'm lyin' to myself that's the truth
It's killing me being without you
You're the only one
not fooling anyone
I'm lyin' to myself

I won't lie here
Alone in this bed
Broken record
Of your voice in my head
'Cause nothing that you said
Had any real effect on me

There's not a thing that I would change
No not much only everything
Just to have you again

I'm lyin' to myself every night
Without you baby nothing's been right
No matter what I say
Can't make you go away
I'm lyin' to myself

I can't deny it anymore
Gotta get you back in my life
'Cause that's all I've been living for

And I'm lyin' to myself
You're the only one
Not fooling anyone
I been lyin' to myself
No matter what I say
Can't make you go away
I'm lyin' to myself
