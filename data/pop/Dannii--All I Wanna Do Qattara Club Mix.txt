All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 All I wanna do
 All I wanna do
 
 Take a look inside my heart
 Tell me what you think you see
 I may not be the innocent girl
 That you wanted me to be
 
 Some nights I just wanna lover
 Some nights I don't need a friend
 Some nights I just need somebody
 To hold me 'till the end because
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 Take a look inside my heart
 Tell me what you think you need
 You may not see the innocent girl
 That you keep inside your dreams, because
 
 Some nights I just wanna lover
 Some nights I don't need a friend
 Some nights I just need somebody
 To hold on 'till the end because
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 Take a look inside my heart
 
 All I wanna
 
 Take a look inside my heart
 Tell me what you think you see
 I may not be the innocent girl
 That you wanted me to be
 
 Some nights I just wanna lover
 Some nights I don't need a friend
 Some nights I just need somebody
 To hold on 'till the end because
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 All I wanna do is touch you
 All I wanna do, all I wanna do
 
 Take a look inside my heart
 Take a look inside my heart
