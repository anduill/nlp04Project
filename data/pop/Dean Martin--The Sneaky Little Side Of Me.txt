There's a sneaky little side of me, the kind I want to set you free
So I can go see what's waitin' just over the hill
Every now and then I hear something whisper in my ear
Telling me somebody else could give me a thrill

Oh, the sneaky little side of me, the kind I want to go and see
If I could be happier walking with somebody new
But every time I start to go, something in my heart says no
And tells me how lucky I am belongin' to you

And this sneaky little side of me is learning fast
'Bout the way I'm livin' and the love I'm givin'
And the love that's gonna last

When you meet me at the door each night
And put your arms around me tight
I know that there just couldn't be anyone sweeter than you

Suddenly to my surprise, I begun to realize
That the sneaky little side of me is in love with you too
Oh, suddenly to my surprise, I begun to realize
That the sneaky little side of me is in love with you too

Sneaky little side of me, sneaky little side of me
Sneaky little side of me, sneaky little side of me
