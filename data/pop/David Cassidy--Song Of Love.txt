People everywhere seem to think
I won't survive, one day I'll sink
Well, I guess
I value less what they think
Than the song that I sing
And the hope that it brings

Oh...It's a song, a song of love
And to me your heart is a choir
Life is the song
And the theme is love
Give me my share and I'll get by

I can never seem to achieve
All that the world tells me I need
Guess they choose
To see the things that I'm not
But an ace in the hole
Now that much I've got

Oh...It's a song, a song of love
And to me your heart is a choir
Life is the song
And the theme is love
Give me my share and I'll get by

Life is full of lots of happenings
Oh, but they don't mean much
Without you
And I know in the end
If you're my friend
I won't get caught with nothing to do

So, I think I'll just stay the same
Taking what comes and laugh at the rain
And you know
I just might make it through
As long as we keep what's between me and you

Oh...It's a song, a song of love
And to me your heart is a choir
Life is the song
And the theme is love
Give me my share and I'll get by
