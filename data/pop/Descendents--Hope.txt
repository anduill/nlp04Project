Why can't you see you torture me
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home
You'll be in his arms and I’ll be gone 
But I know my day will come
I know someday I’ll be the only one 

So now you wait for his spark 
You know it'll turn you on 
He's gonna make you feel 
The way you want to feel 
When he starts to lie 
When he makes you cry 
You know I’ll be there 
My day will come i know 
Someday I’ll be the only one 

Call me selfish 
Call me what you like
I think it's right 
To want someone for all your own 
And not to share her love 
And I’ll have my way 
And won't have to say anyway 
Cause I’ve got you 
You don't stand a chance 

So now you wait for his cock 
You know it'll turn you on 
He's gonna make you feel 
The way you want to feel 
When he starts to lie 
When he makes you cry 
You know I’ll be there 
My day will come 
I know someday I’ll be the only one

My day will come 
I know someday I’ll be the only one

So you want perfection 
I see your self destruction 
You don't know what you want 
It's gonna take you years to find out 
I’m not giving up 
And when you've had enough 
You'll take your bruised little head 
And you'll come running back to me 
You know that I’m gonna be the only one.
