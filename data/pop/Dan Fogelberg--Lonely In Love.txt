Some say that love is its own, love is its own reward
But I can't help but believe there's got to be more
A man needs a woman to have and to hold
To love him in body as well as in soul
I need your desire, where did the fire go?

I keep trying to sleep but sleep won't be mine tonight
There's so much sorrow inside and baby, I don't know why?
I give you your freedom, I give you my love
I give all I have every time that we touch
I don't know, baby, maybe I give too much

Now, I'm lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love?
I'm so lonely in love
Baby, why must I be lonely?
Why must I be lonely in love?

I know that love carries no, she carries no guarantees
But still I can't seem to find a reason that I can believe in
You said to be patient and give you some room
You said you had changes you need to work through
But the longer I wait the farther I feel from you

Now, I'm lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love?
I'm so lonely in love
Baby, why must I be lonely?
Why must I be lonely in love?

I'm so lonely in love
Why must I be lonely in love? Darling
I'm so lonely in love
Baby, you're my one and only
Why do you keep me lonely in love
