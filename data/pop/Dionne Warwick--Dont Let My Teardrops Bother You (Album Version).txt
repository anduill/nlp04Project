If I should shed a tear
It's just the love I'm showing, you're leaving here
If I should shed my pride
It's just to show how much I love you so

And where you go, my love will be there with you
No matter where you are or if you find someone new
Long ago, I reeled my life to you
And I can change my heart even though we'll be apart

Don't let my teardrops bother you
The reason I'm crying I can't believe we're through
Don't let my teardrops bother you
If you must leave me do what you gotta do

If I should beg and plead
It's just because of love and the need I have for you
If I should stall for time
It's just because I'm praying you'll change your mind
And maybe find, there's something you're leaving behind

Maybe you'll see where you've been blind
But if someone has managed to erase me
And she's-a what you want, if she's what you want
She's what you want to replace me

Don't let my teardrops bother you
The reasons I'm crying I can't believe we're through
Don't let it, don't let my teardrops bother you
If you must leave me, do what you gotta do

Don't let my teardrops bother you
The reasons I'm crying
