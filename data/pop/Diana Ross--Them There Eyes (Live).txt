I fell in love with you
The first time I looked into
Them there eyes
'Cause you have a certain
Little cute way of flirting with
Them there eyes

They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue
I'm falling, no stalling
In a great big way for you

My heart is jumping
You started something with
Them there eyes
You better look out
Little brown eyes
If you're wise

They sparkle, they bubble
Gonna get you in a whole lotta trouble
Ooh baby, them there eyes
