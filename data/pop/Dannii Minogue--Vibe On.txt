(Oh yeah)
Oh my God
Look what she's got in her bag
Does anyone know where I can get one of those?

(Vibes)

Instead of just lying there
Why don't you show me that you're powerful?
I, I put in XXX batteries
Just so you'd give me something wonderful
Turn you on

Change you up, fast and slow
'Till I find the frequency I like

(Chorus)
Plug it in give me my vibe on
Give me vibrations
That's what gets my ride on
Gotta have vibrations
Jump on top it, sit right on it
Plug in give me my vibe on
Gotta have vibrations

(Vibes)

I don't wanna put you down 
Looks like I'm a vibraholic now
I, I need you coming with me everywhere
Lately I smile so much I'm getting stares 

Change you up fast and slow
'Till I find the frequency I like

(Chorus)
Plug it in give me my vibe on
Give me vibrations
That's what gets my ride on
Gotta have vibrations
Jump on top it, sit right on it
Plug in give me my vibe on
Gotta have vibrations x2

(Rap)
(Ugh) Be like giving me vibrations
The ultimate stimulation 
Straight out of the box
Ugh, no hesitation
Your speakers like a pony that I love to ride
Making me crazy when the volume's high
You're compact so I can take you anywhere I want
Make my friends scream out loud
"I want what she's got"
Supernatural doing things that normal man can't do
So let me take you out, and try you out, I'm in the mood

Change you up fast and slow
'Till I find the frequency I like

(Chorus)
Plug it in give me my vibe on
Give me vibrations
That's what gets my ride on
Gotta have vibrations
Jump on top it, sit right on it
Plug in give me my vibe on
Gotta have vibrations

Keep on giving me, keep on giving me vibrations x4
Plug it in give me my vibe on
Give me vibrations
