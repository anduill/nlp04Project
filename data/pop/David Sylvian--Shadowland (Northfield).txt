Shine upon my hour, 
Shadowland
Cold cold winter hands
Shine upon my hour
Shadowland

Mountain we bear, mountain fall
Climbing up the charcoal trees
By God's grace she sings to me

Shine upon my hour, shine upon my hour

And after dark, who lays you down
After dark who lays you down

Starlight we bear, starlight fall
Shining up the amber leaves
By God's grace she sings to me

Shine upon my hour,
Shadowland
Cold, cold winter hands
And after dark who lays you down
