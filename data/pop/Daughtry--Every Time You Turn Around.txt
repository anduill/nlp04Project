I been me
i been followin' my dreams
try to findthe scene where you belived me
i been true i been waiting her for you
i been patient,understanding, and believing
chorus
(every time you turn around)

i know you're standing there
waiting for me to take it on back down the other road baby
but i won't let ya down
i know you standing there
waiting for me to take it on back down the other road baby
but i won't let ya down
every time youu turn around

i been good
i been doin' what i should
workin'hard to make a world that we can live in
i been strong
i been holding out so long
and i don't you to forget that you're forgiven

rit.

all the resons yuo believe what you believe
never seeing that the truth is a part of me
when all i wanna do is show you what it really means to love
what it really means to love
