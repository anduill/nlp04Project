Hello, world, here's a song that we're singin', 
C'mon get happy 
A whole lotta lovin' is what we'll be bringin', 
We'll make you happy 

We had a dream we'd go trav'lin' together 
We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on 
Somethin' always happens whenever we're together 
We get a happy feelin' when we're singin' a song 

Trav'lin' along there's a song that we're singin', 
C'mon get happy 
A whole lotta lovin' is what we'll be bringin', 
We'll make you happy 
We'll make you happy, 
We'll make you happy
