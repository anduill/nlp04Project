Drowning with the poor man 
Relax system 
I love you still
I'd try to come back if I could 
Vacant on the weekends 
Any ex-boyfriends a little tired
of being a lot misunderstood

And I’ve paid bills, won’t pay any more 
Isn’t this an ordinary soul? 
Styrofoam 

I don’t ever feel warm 
Like grass stains 
And I’m stone cold 
Whatever’s left, I’m too tied up to come undone

Write it down on pamphlets 
Perfect we’re just perfect 
Whatever’s left, it’s not so easy when you’re dumb 

Some of them good and some of them bad 
But I always ease along 'cause I’m alone 
Styrofoam

And Some of them good
Some of them bad
But I always ease along 'cause I’m alone
Styrofoam
Styrofoam
