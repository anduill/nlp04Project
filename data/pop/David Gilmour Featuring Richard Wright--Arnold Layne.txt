Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine

On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view
See through baby blue
He got it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Two to know, why can't you see?

Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught
A nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang, he hates it

Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Two to know, why can't you see?

Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne, don't do it again
