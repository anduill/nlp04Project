I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time when I'm
With my baby
It's no fun with the sun around
But I get going when the sun goes down
And I meet my baby

That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss and then we kiss some more
Don't ask me how many times we kiss at a time like this
Who keeps score

So I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby

That's when we kiss and kiss and kiss and then we kiss some more
Don't ask me how many times we kiss at a time like this
Who keeps score
So I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
