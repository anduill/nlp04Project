[Verse 1]

It's a waiting game you play
Still, you think that you can win
So you play on, play on
And the rush hour weaves you home
In another day you'll break
You will break down
You will break down
I know it
Like me

[Hook]

Don't be that way, don't act like that
Don't be, no don't be
Please don't be like me

[Verse 2]

On the business card you leave
Is a name that you don't own
Credit given, credit taken
Yeah you take it
In another day you'll sink
You're the only one afloat
But the best move if you make it
You won't make it
Is to leave

[Hook]
