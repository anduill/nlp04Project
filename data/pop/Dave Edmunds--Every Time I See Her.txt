Words spill out on an empty page,
Every time I see her,
My friends say 'better act your age',
Every time I see her.

I don't care if it seems I've lost my mind,
Is it just imagination or does something crazy happen every time?

I wanna hold her but I lose my grip,
Every time I see her,
I fall in love coz I always drift,
Every time I see that girl.

I try to turn away but I gotta look back,
Every time I see her,
I feel like a train coming off the track,
Every time I see her.

I don't know if it seems I've lost control,
I don't know if what I'm feeling is really love, I just don't know.

I wanna tell her that I love her but I lose my nerve,
Every time I see her,
My tongue gets tied and I'm lost in the words,
Every time I see her.

I wanna hold her but I lose my grip,
Every time I see her,
I fall in love coz I always drift,
Every time I see that girl.

I don't care if it seems I've lost my mind,
Is it just imagination or does something crazy happen every time?

I try to stay cool but I lose my head,
Every time I see her,
She looks me in the eyes and my brain goes dead,
Every time I see her.

I don't know if it seems I've lost control,
I don't know if what I'm feeling is really love, I just don't know.

I wanna hold her but I lose my grip,
Every time I see her,
I fall in love coz I always drift,
Every time I see that girl.

I wanna tell her that I love her but I lose my nerve,
Every time I see her,
My tongue gets tied and I'm lost in the words,
Every time I see that girl.

Every time I see that girl
Every time I see that girl
Every time I see that girl
Every time I see that girl
Every time I see that girl
Every time I see that girl
