What's your sign? Do you know?
Let me guess? You're Scorpio?
What's your rising? Where's your moon?
Scorpios are pretty cool. See I'm a Sag.
So they say. I'm a butterfly, I like to play.
I'm always aiming into the sky.
I point my arrows, extremely high.

Chorus:
'Cos everyone, has a sign.
Whether supernatural or divine.
Believe or not, if you're so inclined.
'Cos in this great big universe
We're the stars on earth

See the man, over there. He's a Leo,
Check his hair. Virgo eyes.Aries smile
I like the Leo. Check his style.
When the night is good and clear
I hear the whisper in my ear
If you follow the Nothern Star
You will alays know, just where you are.

Chorus

We are stars doo doot, doo doot, doo yeah.
We are stars doo doo doot, doo doot,
Doo yeah. We are stars. Cos in this great big universe
We're stars on earth.

So what's your sign. Let me guess? I dunno.
I do confess. What's your rising? Where's your moon?
I dunno, but you're still cool!

Chorus

We are stars doo doot, doo doot, doo yeah.
We are stars doo, doo doot, doo doot, doo yeah.
We are stars. Cos in this great big universe
We are stars on earth, Yeah (x3)
You believe in me (x4)
Yeah, dooh doot, doo. Doo doot doo.
