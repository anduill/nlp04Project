Was there something more I could have done?
Or was I not meant to be the one?
Where's the life I thought we would share?
And should I care?

And will someone else get more of you?
Will she go to sleep more sure of you?
Will she wake up knowing you're still there?
And why should I care?

There's always one to turn and walk away,
And one who just wants to stay.
But who said that love is always fair?
And why should I care?

Should I leave you alone here in the dark,
Holding my broken heart?
While a promise still hangs in the air-
And why should I care?
