Ooh, he's so mighty fine
(And it really got me)
Ooh, he's so mighty fine

(Verse 1)
Sweet on love and mighty fine
Yours are the lips of my design
Gonna fly, thru the night
What we find, so inviting
Sweet on love feel mighty fine

(Break)
And the music keeps on moving
Ooh, and the music keeps on moving

Zip zip zip zip

(Chorus)
Zip a de day, just sail your troubles away
Do like you wanna do
Zip a de day, tomorrow's drifting away
Do like you wanna do

Ooh, he's so mighty fine

(Verse 2)
He's got a love, i'm mesmurised
And his is the sparkle in my eyes
On and on, thru the night
What we find, so inticing
He's got a love, so mighty fine

Zip zip zip zip

(Repeat chorus)

(Chorus)
Zip a de day, just sail (your troubles away)
Oh you can do like you wanna do
Zip a de day, tomorrow's drifting away
Do like you wanna do

Ooh, he's so mighty fine, and it really got me
(And the music keeps on movin')
Ooh, he's so mighty fine

On and on, thru the night
What we fine, inticing
Sweet on love and mighty fine

Zip zip zip zip

(Chorus)
Zip a de day, just sail (your troubles away)
Oh you can do like you wanna do
Sip a de day, tomorrow's drifting away
Do like you want, do like you want

(Chorus)
(Zip a de day, just sail your troubles away)
You can do like you wanna do, oh yeah
(Zip a de day, tomorrow's drifting away)
Do like you wanna do

Oh, mighty fine
Mighty fine
Oh, mighty fine
Mmm, mighty fine
