Some said the Jaybird to the Cockatoo
Want a commitment
From inside the zoo
Say hey birdbrain why be sly
Tell me how a rockbird can learn to fly
Hello Joe whadooya konw
I just got back from the animal show
I left my history teacher
Sitting in the bleachers
And got back in time to see the second
Half of creature features
CHORUS
Rockbird pretty boy
Rockbird pretty boy
Fast as light
Rockbird pretty boy
Rockbird pretty boy
Meteorite
Back at the compound they start to get up
Looking at the bottom
Of an empty cup
Say hey they got the tropics
With the migratory
Back to basics a tweedle dee dee
REPEAT CHORUS
Got to get a go-go get me outa this cage
Birdland dancing is all the rage
Gotta get me up there for a bird`s eye view
ItÂ´s bird walking weather
See ya back at the zoo.
