OK 
The sun is up should be feeling great, 
Your feeling rough got too much on your plate, 
A busy day got a lot to do, 
a heavy head you think you've caught the flu. 
Something deep inside begins to stir, 
spirit, conscience your not really sure. 
It's gonna be o.k 
It's gonna be o.k 

Another day your late for work, 
The shower's cold you ain't got no clean shirt. 
A cup of tea just might do the trick, 
the milk's gone off by now your feeling sick. 
Something deep inside begins to stir, 
spirit, conscience your not really sure. 
It's gonna be o.k 

We laughed, we cried, we shared along the way. 
We did some things we knew we shouldn't do. 
But after all, what's this life living for, 
Your wasting time if your just keeping score. In every thing we try to do what's right. 
In trying way too hard we get it wrong. 
So after all what's this life living for,
Work it out or head straight for the door.
It's gonna be o.k 
It's gonna be o.k 

You close your eyes, try to sleep. 
Scold yourself for hours that you keep. 
Drifting off will I dream tonight? 
In my dreams perhaps I'll get it right. 
Something deep inside begins to purrr, 
spirit conscience your not really sure. 

It's gonna be o.k. 
It's gonna be o.k, either way. 
It's gonna be o.k.
