I like your time I like your thinking
and drowning in your weird obsessions
I kiss your feet as you are walking by
and feel your potion on my lips

the sundance and your eyes
invincibly combined
still wondering what to pray for
tell me why I die to please you

I wait for you I wait for you now

Shouldn’t it be sad that one’s alive
unjust sentence to endure
reminding all the tears we drank together
you cannot leave me all alone

hesitation and my mind
invincibly combined
still wondering what to pray for
tell me why I die to please you

I wait for you I wait for you now
Your hazy breath -intoxicating-
illumination starts to fade
Blinded eyes cannot see a companion
a divided soul I offer to repay

I won’t rely on someone’s patience
another vision of delight
my childhood fears should lie in graves now
innocence I must deny

I wait for you I wait for you now
