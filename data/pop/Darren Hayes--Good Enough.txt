If I woke up late 
Couldn’t get out of bed 
If I bought you a cafe latte instead 
If I lied when I said 
32 inches was the size of my waist 
And can I admit 
Every once in a while 
Even though I dig alternative style 
Occasionally 
I can be caught dancin’ to Brittany 
And can I confess 
That art house doesn’t turn me on 
But I like every single thing that Speilberg’s done

Could I be good enough 
Could I be good enough 
If the going got worse
And the worse got rough 
The days became endless 
And harder than tough 
I’d be good enough 
Better than best 
Would be simply to be good enough 
If everything I give 
Doesn’t seem like a lot 
If it’s all that I got 
Baby tell that could be good enough

Where I grew up
The rent was cheap 
Though we always had enough to eat 
Didn’t have fancy clothes 
I never really cared
'Coz there were shoes on my toes 
And motherly love
I knew it like the back of my hand 
She always had a way to make me understand 

I could be good enough 
I could be good enough 
If the going got worse 
And the worse got rough 
The days became endless 
And harder than tough 
I’d be good enough 
Better than best 
Would be simply to be good enough 
If everything I give
Doesn’t seem like a lot 
If it’s all that I got 
Baby tell me that could be good enough

Coz I don’t know which way this road is gonna turn 
But I know it’s gonna be fine 
But there are some days no matter how much I’ve learned 
That the road gets tough 
And I don’t feel good enough 
But if you’re giving me some of that loving 
Could you pass some over 
Let me cry on your shoulder and tell me baby 
I could be good enough

If I lost my job 
And my hair fell out 
If I made no sense 
And I scream and shout 
Would you laugh at me? 
Never take a word I say seriously 
And if I’m out in the cold 
Waiting in the back of the line 
Too afraid to drop my name for fear of decline

Could you tell me I’m good enough? 
Could I be good enough? 
If the going got worse 
And the worse got rough 
The days became endless 
And harder than tough 
I’d be good enough 
Better than best
Would be simply to be good enough 
If everything I give 
Dosn’t seem like a lot 
If it’s all that I’ve got 
Baby tell me that could be good enough

I need to know that I could be good enough 
Because everybody wants to feel good enough 
Show me baby 
Tell me 
Come on a prove it baby and
Give it to me
