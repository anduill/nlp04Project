When I woke up tonight I took a pill
The last one I possessed, at least until
Before my morning cigarette I take a pill
And when I feel lacklustre, I take another pill
To keep me slim line to keep me fit and strong
So I look good in a tee shirt, all night long
And so come the daybreak I got too much to lose
So I'm asking you up there, I'm asking you up thereâ€¦
What, whatever,
Whatever happened to the blues
Whatever happened to the blues
If it rains when I'm wearing sunglasses,
I take a pill
Stay home and wait 'till ten PM at least until
I can walk the streets in deserted circles
Small talking with my friends, the ones who sell me on the cheap
Amphetamines...
Till at the end of the night, ill at ease
Thinking aloud to myself, about the life I lead
About the life I choose
So for the sake of change, so for the sake of change, so for the sake of change...
What, whatever,
Whatever happened to the blues
Whatever happened to the blues
