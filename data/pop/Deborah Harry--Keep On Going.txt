There'll come a time you need a friend When disappointment follows you around
and although we scheme in the shallow end
Both mice and men continue to be drowned
So if you're out and get caught in the rain
Just give a smile cast your line out again
When you are down keep on going
Determination will change your luck
Don't look around no keep on going
If you believe that you've had enough then you must keep on going
Don't ever give up
And although it's been said before There is always someone worse off than you
With the milk of human kindness on the floor Your tears will only turn it a shade of
blue

So if you're out and get caught in the rain
Just give a smile cast your line out again
When you are down keep on going
Determination will change your luck
Don't look around no keep on going
If you believe that you've had enough then you must keep on going
Don't ever give up
