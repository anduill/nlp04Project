Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
It's left this house empty now, not sure if I belong
Yesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant song
I'll do my best now but you've been gone now for so long

The window's open now and the winter settles in
We'll call it Christmas when the adverts begin
I love your depression and I love your double chin
I love most everything you bring to this offering

Oh I know that I've left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you so please throw down your hair

[Chorus]
At night I dream without you
And hope I don't wake up
Cause waking up without you 
Is like drinking from an empty cup

Woke up and for the first time the animals were gone
Our clocks are ticking now so before our time is gone
We can get a house and some boxes on the lawn
We can make babies and accidental songs

I know I've been a liar and I know I've been a fool
I hope we didn't break it but I'm glad we broke the rules
My cave is deep now yet your light is shining through
I cover my eyes, still all I see is you

Oh I know I've left you in places of despair
Oh I know that I love you so please throw down your hair
