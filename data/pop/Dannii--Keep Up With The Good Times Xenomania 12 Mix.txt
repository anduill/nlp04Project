Hold me tight
When I’m feeling down
I fear the night
When you’re not around

Kiss me when the morning comes
Leave the taste of you
I’m waitin for daylight
I will, I’ll wait, for you

[Chorus:]
The good times that we share
For all the love, that you give me
I may not be a perfect girl
But in my weakest hour
You’re the air that I’m breathin
Like the moonlit, sky, above
The good times that we share
Cos when I’m with you
I feel so alive

I’ll never find
Someone betta than you
Don’t leave me behind
After all we’ve been through

Kiss me when the morning comes
Leave the taste of you
I’m waitin for daylight
I will, I’ll wait, for you

[Chorus]

Feel so, feel so, feel so alive (x 4)

When I’m with you
I feel so alive
Feel so, feel so, feel so alive

[Chorus]
