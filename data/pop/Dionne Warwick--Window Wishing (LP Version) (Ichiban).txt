Through my window I just saw you
You were walkin' by with someone new
Oh what I'd give to be walkin' with you

Window wishin', that's all I do
Just window wishin' because of you
Without your love I can't go on
And face this world

For me there'll never be another you
Oo-ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh-ooh
Oo-ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh-ooh

I'll just be hopin' and prayin' you'll be callin'
And you'll say let's give love one more try
If our love ends when you call I wi-ill die

So I stay here, all through day
A million teardrops can't wash away
The ache I feel here in my heart
Now that you're gone

And now I cry, I'm . . .
Window wishin', you're lonely to
And window wishin', the way I do
But not to me
Without your love I can't go on

For me there'll never be another
There will never-never be another
Oh no, never-never be another
And window wishin', a window wishin'
Oh-oh there will never-never be another
Oh no, never-never be another

And awindow-ow wishin', oh-oh window wishin'
Yeah-eah, there will never-never be another
Oh no, never-never be another, a window wishin'
