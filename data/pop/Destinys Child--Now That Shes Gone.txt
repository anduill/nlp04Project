(Chorus)
Now that she's gone, you wanna come back
Is that a fact? 
You've got it like that 
You've made me wait too long, I'm gone 
Now that she's gone, you wanna come back
Is that a fact? 
You've got it like that 
You've made me wait too long, I'm gone 

Take her to the movies, dinner all the time 
Shopping sprees for her; on me you never spent a dime 
But I was there for you when you had nothing at all 
Then you got a lil job and she's the one you call and 

(Chorus) 

You've taken me for granted but you only get one chance 
Then you left me hurting and it won't happen again 
So she finally left you, it ain't no surprise 
That you miss your water 'cause your well went dry 

(Chorus 2X) 

Bridge: 
Understand, I understand, why you think I want you back 
After what you did to me 
Did you think you blinded me? 
Boy you know whatever you do it will all come back to you 
'Cause you tried to play me like a fool 
Understand, I understand, why you think I want you back 
After what you did to me 
Did you think you blinded me? 
Boy you know whatever you do it will all come back to you 

(Chorus with adlibs to fade)
