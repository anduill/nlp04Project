there's a shadow on his photograph
on tinian'45
smiling like a college boy
who's glad to be alive
but now he owns a factory
and a store in los alamos
a wife called beverly
sells second hand ford motors

he may have taken pictures
been caught in albuquerque
flown in "great artiste"
on a mushroom cloud
now he may be a senator
or a general or a turn key
but i know he looks like spencer tracy now

and he cries all night
and he cries all night
and he cries all night
and he cries all night

and he may have been with oppenheimer
shaken einsteins hand
said "did we have to drop the bomb"
