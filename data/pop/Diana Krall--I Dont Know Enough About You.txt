I know a little bit
About a lot of things
But I don't know enough about you
Just when I think you're mine
You try a different line
Baby, what can I do?

I read the latest news
No buttons on my shoes
Baby, I'm confused about you
You've got me in a spin
And what a spin I'm in
'Cause I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades, master of none
And isn't it a shame
I'm so sure that you'd be good for me
If you'd only play my game

You know I went to school
And I'm nobody's fool
That is to say until I met you
I know a little bit about a lot things
'Cause I don't know enough about you

I know a bit about biology
A little more about psychology
I'm a little gem in geology
But I don't know enough about you
