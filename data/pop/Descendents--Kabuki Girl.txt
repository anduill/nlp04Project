Look out get out of my way
I'm going to the atomic cafe 
I'm going to the atomic cafe 
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl

Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow
I want to see you tonight
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl

Your face is white 
Your hair is black 
You'll probably stab me in the back 
But that's the chance I'm gonna take 

Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow
I want to see you tonight
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl

East is east, west is west 
Girls from the east are the best
They got more of what I'm lookin' for

Ahhhhhh! 
Look out get out of way 
I'm going to the atomic cafe
I'm going to the atomic cafe 
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl
