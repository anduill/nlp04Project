Oh you better watch out you better not cry 
You better not pout I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is coming to town 
And he's a making a list and checking in twice 
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice 
Santa Claus is coming to town 

He sees you when you're sleeping he knows when you're awake 
He knows if you've been bad or good so be good for goodness sake 
Oh you better watch out you better not cry 
You better not pout I'm telling you why 
Santa Claus is comin' to town 

(Santa Claus is comin' to town) 

He sees you when you're sleeping...
