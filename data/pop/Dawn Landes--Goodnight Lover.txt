Goodnight, lover

Lover, goodnight

Will we meet each other in a dream tonight

And will you remember the color of my eyes

Set in a million tigers sleeping on their sides

Ooh, sleeping on their sides (x3)



Goodnight, lover

Lover, goodnight

Will you roll over in the bed tonight

Turning a million circles, dancing in the night

Like dancing on your side

Dancing on your side 

Dancing on your side

Sleeping on our sides

Ooh, sleeping on our sides

Ooh, dancing all the night

Ooh, sleeping on our sides

Ooh, dancing to the night

Turning, turning



Goodnight, lover

Lover, goodnight
