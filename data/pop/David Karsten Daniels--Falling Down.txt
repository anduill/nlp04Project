driving fast on a icy mountain pass
we came bulleting off the road
and flailing, clutching anything
(my stomach in my throat)
i screamed to my passengers, "I love you"
and i prayed to what I do not know
I hoped we would not suffer
but the car it did not slow
-
and flying through the darkness
not stopping, and missing all the trees
i couldn't help but remember
that thought i often think -
that maybe I'm invincible
I just don't think I can die
but in the seconds seeming like hours
I came to see I might
-
I was quite sure we're gaining speed
the outcome seemed more certain
approaching terminal velocity
and I thought about the movies
a ball of flames, exploding noise
and all of it so romantic
falling down the mountain, plummeting with my boys
-
and that's when we finally hit the ground
careening hundreds of feet
I knew we wouldn't go out pleasantly
(pressed into a tree)
but all the sudden we're just stopped there
intact, our limbs and heads
silent and not moving
amazed to find that we're not dead
we're amazed that we're not dead
