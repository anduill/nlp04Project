It takes all sorts, it takes all kinds
It takes time and I've taken sides
I've got friends who've made enemies
Those who wave banners on bended knee
Those who only see what's visible
Have both eyes closed and stand in the middle
Hand raised laughing to take the pledge
Hiding under the active edge
Fighting Irish to be heard
Fighting Irish wrong word
Fighting Irish shout it loud
Fighting Irish stand proud
I wouldn't be seen dead in a Paisley shirt
Or held at point blank range with my face in the dirt
I can sympathise but offer no solution
They can kill the revolutionary they can't kill the revolution
I can only listen if you want me to hear
I can live in peace while you live in fear
The bridge is burnt, the water's in the way
But I'll see your side of town come judgement day
Fighting Irish to be heard
Fighting Irish wrong word
Fighting Irish shout it loud
Fighting Irish stand proud
