Jealousy rides with me
such a faithful companion no one could be
and he sits on my shoulder
and whispers the things that make me so bitter its sick
jealousy rides with me
in wake or in slumber I can't get relief
from the pictures he paints of the passion in heat
and though I try I can't stop listening

and I've tried bribery, but to no effect
cause there's no amount of money that would get him to split
as long as I'm living and we're not together
I'll be chained to this beast with no chance of severance 'cause


jealousy rides with me
such a faithful companion no one could be
for a journey that leads to the outskirts of time
but don't worry about me, I'll be fine
it beats being lonely, I'll be fine.
