I'm listening to the talking 
let my mind stop walking 
I'll be strong I can understand 
he held her tightly 
she held him tighter 
the heavens stand between where they stand

well all that I have now's a glass full of memories 
reasons beyond me I'm alone 
I stand in my own light whilst in the shadows 
you remind me of me

standing to tenderness 
where we stay clear 

we are together yet we are apart 
going our own way to find where we start 
we are together yet we are apart 
going our own way 

conversation going on all around me 
I join some I leave some and some never found me 
hearing that music up in the peat? 
my heart starts a twitching to who I will meet

my time is all I've got 
it's so bad watching it drift away 
whilst I long to understand 
all I do in just one day

we are together yet we are apart 
going our own way to find where we start

my time is all I've got 
it's so bad watching it drift away 
whilst I long to understand 
all I do in just one day

I stand in my own light whilst in the shadows 
you remind me of me 
standing to tenderness 
where we stay clear 

we are together yet we are apart 
going our own way to find where we start 
we are together yet we are apart 
going our own way 
going our own way 
going our own way
