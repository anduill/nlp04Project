You lookin' like first class
Acting like a cheap date
Honey drippin' smile, so stylin'
Bet you know what you do
Don't you, baby?

Eyes that penetrate
Heat that degenerates
Lust communicates
I can hardly wait to get to you
And show you, baby

If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around, pick you up and go down
If you want to I can be just like you
And do the dirty things you do

You walk into a room
Inpeceptible boom
Tight shot, close zoom
When you move it's assumed
You feel it too
Don't you, baby?

Tickin' like a fuse
There's an itch I gotta stratch
Ten minutes in a room to get this monkey off my back
Any dark space would do to show you, baby

If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around, pick you up and go down
If you want to I can be just like you
And do the dirty things you do

Why don't you tell me your sign?
I hear we're two of a kind
Scorpio, I been told, you're my most compatible ride
Let me tell you again
You make me wanna pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Tap into the movie inside my brain
I never wanna stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
Can you do that again?
You make me wanna bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Shut the blinds, baby, let the door slam
Intergalactic, super bombastic, go from the top
Baby, don't ever stop till I tell you to

If you want to I can be dirty too
I can spin you around pick you up even go down
If you want to I can be just like you and be dirty too

Scorpio, I been told you're my most compatible ride

Fade to black, commercial break
This is where the censor kicks in
I think you better close your eyes, block your ears
This could be the jam of the year
