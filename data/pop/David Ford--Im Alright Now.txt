The tide came in and nearly buried us here 
We saw things like they wouldn't believe
You hear a lot about stories about love and romance
But I swear nothing quite like you and me

And every scar sits like a marker
Every line on the face is a small souvenir
Of all the places, be they good or be they bad
That we stopped into on the journey to here

So maybe I lost my sense of direction
But I'm alright now
Every man needs a little affection
So I'm alright now

There were times when, yeah, alright I'll confess
I did things of which I am not proud
Everybody wades through the same colored shit
But it doesn't drag everyone down

And I was stupid, I was insensitive, 
I was all the things I promised that I never would be
I've seen a lot of foolish behavior in my time
But I tell ya, they've got nothing on me

So maybe I lost my sense of direction
But I'm alright now
Every man needs a little affection
So I'm alright now
Give me strength, give me something to believe in
And I'm alright now
Sing along when your heart's finished bleeding
Yeah, I'm alright now

Another evening of sublime self-destruction 
To the tune of a thousand cigarettes
Where every nail thats hammered into your spirit 
Was unable to sink you just yet

And television is just some weak anaesthetic
To numb the senses til you're out like a light
Like all these drugs they seem to promise you the earth
and then they don't keep you warm in the night

So maybe I lost my sense of direction
But I'm alright now
Every man needs a little affection
So I'm alright now
Give me strength, give me something to believe in
And I'm alright now
Sing along when your heart's finished bleeding
Yeah, I'm alright now

It's like I cannot sleep for dreaming
This is everything that could have possibly hoped it would be
A lot of stories will end happy ever after
But I swear nothing quite like you and me
