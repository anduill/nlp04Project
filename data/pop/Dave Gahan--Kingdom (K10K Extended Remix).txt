Can you feel me coming? 
Open the door, it's only me 
I have that desperate feeling 
And trouble is were I'm going to be 

I know you hear me knocking 
So open the door and set me free 

If there's a kingdom beyond it all 
Is there a God that loves us all 
Do we believe in love at all? 
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool 

So in your infinite wisdom 
You show me how this life should be 
All your love and glory 
Doesn't mean that much to me 

If there's a kingdom beyond it all 
Is there a God that loves us all 
Do we believe in love at all? 
I'm still pretending I'm not a fool
