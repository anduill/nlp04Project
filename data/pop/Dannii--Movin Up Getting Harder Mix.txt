I'll move any mountain, yeah
I'll cross any sea to get to you
I hear myself counting the hours
I know you wanna get to me too
I know you wanna get to me too
I know you wanna get to me too

Movin' up, mmm yeah
Movin' up now, come on now
Mmm yeah, I wanna see you movin'

I'll move any mountain, yeah
I'll cross any sea to get to you
I hear myself counting the hours
I know you wanna get to me too

And I know whatever I do, wherever I go
I see your face before me
Guess you always knew what you wanted
But I was just too blind to see

And now I'm, I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm gonna get to you
I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you
I'm movin' up, mmm yeah, I wanna see you movin'

Don't take love for granted, no, no, no
'Cause you've got to give to get some back
The love that we planted will keep us growing
Keep me going, keep me on the right track

I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm gonna get to you
I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm movin' up
Movin' up, movin' up, movin' up, movin' up

I'm movin', I'm movin' up (whoo)
I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin' (movin' up now)
I'm movin' up, come on
Movin' up, movin' up

I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm gonna get to you
I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm movin' up
I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, ooh let me get to you, yeah
I'm movin' up, nothing can hold me down
I'm gonna get to you, I'm movin' up (whoo)

Movin' up, movin' up, movin' up, movin' up
I'm movin', I'm movin' up (whoo)
I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin', I'm movin' up
I'm movin', I'm movin' up
