Vigor vim vitality and punch
The ability to act on a sudden hunch
Nerve to tackle the hardest thing
Feet that climb and hands that cling
A heart that never forgets to sing
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
Sand and grit in a concrete base
A friendly smile on an honest face
A spirit that helps when another's down
Knows how to scatter the blackest frown
Love's it's neighbor love's it's town
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
Say "I will" for you know you can
Look for the best in every man
Meet each thundering knockout blow
Come back with a smile 'cause you know
You get the best of the whole damn show
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
That's pep
You know that's pep
