In a dark woods paved with snow living all alone
i forgot long ago what i'm looking for

firecracker lightning seed coming back to me

this is how
you made my heart a hunter

i remember my little seed louder than a dream
i let my golden arrow fly to the bottom of the night
no hounds to guide me no army at my back
i'm gonna stand up

firecracker lightning seed coming closer to me

this is how
you made my heart a hunter

sunrise burns my fortress down crumbling to the ground
i found my arrow my lightning spark buried in my heart
no hounds to guide me no army at my back
i'm gonna stand up

firecracker lightning seed it was always in me

this is how
you made my heart a hunter
