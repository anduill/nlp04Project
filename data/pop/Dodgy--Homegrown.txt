probably the thought of angels playing with my time will fade 
no ones gonna say anything for me cause there all at home where they stayed 
build up and squash between an air of beauty is what we all should breathe 
and here you see is believers...

fill in the pages of tomorrow's yet to be 
well life is changing slowly with it inside me

homegrowns the way that it should be 
if we are really going to see 
homegrown is the way that it should be

seeminglessly endless nights of summer passing slow 
the world surrounds me getting smaller homegrown let it grow

step further down the line carry on everything's just take your time 
step further down the line carry on everything's gonna be just fine

homegrowns the way that it should be 
if we are really going to see 
homegrown is the way that it should be 
homegrown is the way that it should be 
it should be..

homegrowns the way that it should be 
if we are really going to see 
homegrown is the way that it should 
homegrown is the way that it should be
