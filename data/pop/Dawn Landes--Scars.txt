I think, I think I raced you to those crazy shoes you wore

That day, I decided that I wanted, I wanted you maybe

I just wanted the shoes

Fit me

Maybe

Hudson again, might as well be Mars

People everywhere french-kissing in their cars

These romantic scenes denigrate ours

They're scripted and stars

When you gonna get up

Can I get more than shouting, it's not about you, it's about me

Give me something to doubt, something sharp to annull everybody I know has

Scars

Scars

Everyone that I know

Has scars

Maybe later

Much much later

We can compare ours

Everyone that I know has scars

And I'm sorry

About this, about me

Cause I think, I think I raced you to those crazy shoes you wore that day

I decided that 

That I wanted you

Maybe I just wanted the shoes

When you gonna get out

Can I have more than shout

And it's not about you, it's about me

Give you something to doubt, something sharp to annull everybody I know has

Scars

Scars

Everyone that I know

Has scars

Maybe later

Much much later

We can compare ours

Everyone that I know has scars
