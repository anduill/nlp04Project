Once I had a dream before I woke up
When I try to walk I fall asleep
Don't know where I'm going to,
I don't even know where I have been
But still I try to realize the truth
That I have seen
So I pray
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Reveal the precious spell of every moment
Inhale the flow of life in every second
Rely upon the spirit that you hide
Behind a lie
I will keep on trying till the day
That I die
And I pray 
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Take my fear away
Don't lead me astray 
Take my fear away
Don't lead me astray 
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Please, help me, please
Help me to stay on this road and
Don't lead me astray
