In the cold of the full moon 
On this night 
Time itself it slips away 
Now you are mine 
Slowly hours pass 
All through the night 
Together we can disappear 
For a while I am still 
Forever and ever and ever 
Now I am still 
Forever and ever and ever 
Endless 
Endless 
Now I am still 
Endless 
Endless 
Your body is endless 

Watching the hourglass 
On that night 
We touched the stars 
And reached the moon 
For a time 
I'm lost in a moment with you 
It feels right 
We're floating above the stars 
You and I 

I am still 
Forever and ever and ever 
Now I am still 
Forever and ever and ever 
Endless 
Endless 
Now I am still 
Endless 
Endless 
Your body is endless
