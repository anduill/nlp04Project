You kiss me in the rain again and again now 
Your touch is driving me insane, come my way 
I'm riding on top of your waves, I'm head over heels now 
Knowing you and me one day will surely find a way 
No compromising and all I see are brighter skies 
Now I got you by my side 

Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 

Two years on and still I'm head over heels now 
Ups and downs in everyday still you come my way 
I'm lying by your side, another winter is here now 
And I got summer on my mind and together we can find 
No compromising and all I see are brighter skies 
Now I got you by my side 

Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 

Always by my side, heaven can wait now yeah 
Always by my side, heaven can wait now yeah 
Heaven can wait now yeah 

Heaven can wait now yeah 
I've got summer on my mind 
Heaven can wait now yeah 

Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side 
Heaven can wait now you are by my side
