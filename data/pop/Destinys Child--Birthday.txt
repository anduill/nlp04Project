It's your birthday
You don't have to do nothin'

The time has come
And it's finally here
Have a candle light dinner
Or just settle down my dear
Whatever you like
Boy it's all up to you
We can celebrate baby
Cause it's your birthday
Now close your eyes babe
Listen to the melody
Anything you want my sweet
Just ask me
It's the day for us to share
So leave your problems outta' here
It's right here in me
And make this day history

[Chorus]
It's your birthday
We could spend time together
We gonna' celebrate
You and me
It's your birthday
So baby blow out the candle
We gonna' celebrate
You know it's your birthday

I'm sending out invitations
To let all your friends know that
It's your birthday
But all that I really want to' do
Is wrap you up and get in the groove
Keep you all to myself
It's your birthday
Now the mood is right now
And you don't have to fantasize
All your dreams could come true
But it's up to you
If you can't decide boy
Just give me all your mind
I got a surprise
A present that you'll like

[Chorus]

[Repeats]
It's your birthday
You don't have to do nothin'
