[Verse 1]

Take my head out of my hands
I'll never go through this again
I couldn't do it without my friends
Get it out of me
And I won't, I won't
Sweat it
And I won't, I won't
Sweat it

[Verse 2]

"Jack Flo and Josey 19
Come on in, I hope you're clean
Do you know how to use this thing?"
Well I know, I know
And I won't, I won't
Sweat it
And I won't, I won't
Sweat it

[Hook]

And what you do and where you go
And wherever you go, I'll go
We'll never let it come to this
This comforts me, cause I know
We can do most anything
To this I toast and go home
Don't ever let them pull me out
Cause I know I'm not alone

[Verse 2]

So you think you can change my world
And the thought of my little girl
All these things are in my head
And she says, she said
That I won't, I won't
Sweat it
And I won't, I won't
Sweat it
