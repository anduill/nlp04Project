You know the agony
Of seeing it all slip away
Well maybe now you`d be happy
Just to talk it out straight
If it`s just
Slipping away
About the danger of
Believing in plans in hand
About the role that you have in this delecate plan
If it`s just
Slipping away
Let`s talk it out now
Let`s name them one by one
One by one
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
You know danger of believing that the summer`s gone
And with the fading light the feeling that
Love is falling
It`s all just
Slipping away
If you believe in
The dangers that you suppose
You think it can tumble down
None of us knows
It`s all
Slipping away
Let`s talk it out now
Let`s name them one by one
One by one
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Love`s great fears
Can`t you see them burn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
Twist and turn
As you walk and learn
