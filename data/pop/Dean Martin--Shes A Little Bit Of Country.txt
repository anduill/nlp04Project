She's a big city girl in so many ways
She walks and she talks up town
She's got something hard to find now a days
That keeps me hangin' around

She's a little bit country
Makes me think of meadows and clover
Apple pie and a puppy named Rover
And the good old days

Now she don't know what cheatin' means
I ain't got to teach her none of them things
She's a little bit country
And I got country ways

I've been around this trouble old world
But I never found peace of mind
Till I met that pretty little city girl
Lord, you oughta make more of her kind

She's a little bit country
Makes me think of meadows and clover
Apple pie and a puppy named Rover
And the good old days

Now she don't know what cheatin' means
I ain't got to teach her none of them things
She's a little bit country
And I got country ways

Well, she a little bit of country
And I got country ways
