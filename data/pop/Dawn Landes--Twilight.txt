Another starless light

Another dim streetlight

Turn your head just right

Street becomes a sky

Shotting stars go by

They spark and they die

You see the reason why

You never catch them now

Drags along 'till light

Streaks of red vein the sky

But you love twilight



Oh, love me with your body

I need one to hold

Oh, lovee me with your body

I need one to hold

Tonight

In the long, dim light

Streaks of red vein your eyes

Don't you love twilight

Twilight (x24)
