In mornings she's so regal 
that the valley sighs
In the chilly sea that killed her real slow
Now we're swimming up farther with the doll by our sides
Fill the cup 
with these sleepy souls

CHORUS
Shimi Kapoor
It's clear that some things never take
Shimi Kapoor
Please, heal these tears
Shimi Kapoor

She will feel like at tea,
make me laugh all along
With such feats like sex 
only brought upon
Oh lady, oh baby, 
maybe I'll live my lies alone
Jesus, up here, hear me, I, up-up-up ??

CHORUS

Please heal these tears

CHORUS

Some things never
Never never
