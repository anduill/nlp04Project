Kentucky Woman 
She shine in her own kind of light
She'll look at you once in a day
And what's wrong is alright
And I love her, 
God knows I love her

Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She goes to own you
Kentucky Woman

She ain't the kind that gets turned
at the drop of her name
There's somethin inside thats she's got
turns you on just the same
And she loves me
God knows she loves me

Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She goes to own you
Kentucky Woman

I don't want much
The Good Lord's earth beneath my feet
a gentle touch
from that one girl in life is sweet and good
There ain't no doubt, I'm talking about

Kentucky Woman
She gets to know you
She gets to hold you
Kentucky Woman
Kentucky Woman
Kentucky Woman
