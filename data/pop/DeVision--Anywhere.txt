When I'm lonely
Deep inside
A defending hand
Takes me to a friend
When I'm falling
Asleep to dream
Of a naked dawn
Something keeps me warm
I feel better now
That you are so close to me
You make me high
Anywhere
I can taste the joy
When I feel so close to you
You make me high
Anywhere
When I'm leaving
That safe place
Someone knows my way
In the deepest grey
And when I'm missing
Your safe home
I know I'm secure
Everything's so pure
I feel better now
That you are so close to me
You make me high
Anywhere
I can taste the joy
When I feel so close to you
You make me high
Anywhere
