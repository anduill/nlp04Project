Good luck and lost love's knife 
cut a path leading through my life 
I weave through the gusts of change 
as a kite might through the sky. 
I feel down and degraded 
like I felt when you and me began to tire 
And we stopped long ago 
But I thought it was just ceasefire. 

I can leave the past behind like any normal man can do 
But what I find most of the time 
is that I have been left behind you. 
I can feel time pushing me forward 
so what does it matter what direction I'm pointed in? 
No one else used to sing my sad chorus 
Now I feel that they too have joined in. 

Bad luck and lucky breaks 
cut paths right through our lives 
We follow the blind man's bluff 
like lorrys follow white lines in the night. 
And by our nature we are kept alone 
No matter haw long your nails 
you can't cut out of the womb. 
And if I can't crash off-course 
You must be marooned 
and we will not be able to go back to 
the source of this wound.
