When the sun met the moon,
it was for the very first time.
Said the moon to the sun,
where have you been all my life?
Though we come from too different
worlds and we see things so differently.
Moon you light up my sky, sun breathe life into me.
All my life. All my life.

Cool morning, sun and the moon in the sky.
Dancing together. Are you?
Cool evening, beauty makes me wanna cry.

When the sun met the moon,
it was for the very last time.
Said the moon to the sun, please don't cry.
Though we come from too different
worlds and we see things so differently.
Sun you light up my sky. Moon breathe life into me.
Let's fly. Let's fly
