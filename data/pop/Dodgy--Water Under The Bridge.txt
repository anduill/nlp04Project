I need to be a better person
If I am going to get by
S'pose I should go to bed
And not stay out all night
The trouble with me is
I can't find my feet
The trouble with me is water under the bridge
My dad hates me and also does my tree

I need to think more clearly
If I am going to get high
S'pose I should go to bed
And not stay out all night
The trouble with me is
I can't find my feet

The trouble with me is water under the bridge
My dad hates me and also does my tree

I'm still doing fine
I won't serve, I want peace for the world
Or just a little piece of it
I long to be sane and I ache to be sober
But I can't find my feet

The trouble with me is water under the bridge
My dad hates me and also does my tree

The trouble with me is water
The trouble with me is water
The trouble with me is water under the bridge,
bridge (x 16)
