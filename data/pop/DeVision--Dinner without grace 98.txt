Immaculation in your eyes
Depravity within your mind
A suffer from a devotional alliance
Purity is in your smile
A lack of confidence beneath your shy
Another heavenly defiance

They're telling you lies
Privation within their eyes
Don't wait for God's embrace
Let's have a dinner without grace

They're telling you lies
Deceit is in their mind
It's time that in God's face
We have a dinner without grace

Morality will fall apart
A greater scheme deep in your heart
No time for innocence and pride
Sincerity you have to prove
The simulation is too close to truth
Don't mind your chastity tonight
