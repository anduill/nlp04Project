An old man was sitting at his table one day 
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray 
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing 
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know
