Wearing stripes, arms up high, as tall as can be,
nothing more than a frozen smile to see.
In the cage he'll defy all that's logical.
Under lights, stay up all night with his formula.
In the grip in the step of potential rage.
Oh it's hip, formulated to fascinate.
If you do it like this: Jump! Jump!
Do it like this: Jump! Jump!
She moves faster than any eye can see,
moving parts that aren't moved normally.
In the haze what it isn't is what you see.
On and off, up and down, like a yo yo string.
Try to do it like this: Jump! Jump!

Do it for a kiss: Jump! Jump!
Do it like this: Jump! Jump!

They shine, we shield our eyes to see what is the
dazzling and the enchanted.

They whine "come closer to me".
That is the dizzying, the dancing sorcery.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump jump.

Whoa whoa, my little doggie, he does a trick.
Ruff ruff!
He went to school to learn how to sit.

As we decended the exit, got off the bus,
we got friends, we got fans now, and this is proof.
Can you tell me why that guy is on the roof?
Oh ho, do it like this: Jump! Jump!
Try it like this: Jump! Jump!
Do it more like this: Jump! Jump!

Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump.
Jump little doggie. Do what she say. Jump jump.
