And do those feet in modern times
Walk upon the flowers and
Walk upon their brothers while their
Heads are busy lying low
Trying to keep to cover, oh

Something went wrong along the way
Everybody's waiting for judgment day
So they can go "Told you so"
They can go "Told you so"

Bring me my gun of itching desire
Bring me my bullets and I will fire
Sights set higher than the tall church spire

Something went wrong along the way
Everybody's waiting for judgment day
So they can go "Told you so"
They can go "Told you so"

Standing in line, the blind lead the blind
Waiting and waiting for an overdue sign
Brothers and sisters playing Chinese Whispers
If things aren't suited then they'll get diluted

Here's one more dead with a hole in his head
He shouldn't have said all the things he said
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled

Something went wrong along the way
Everybody's waiting for judgment day
So they can go "Told you so"
They can go "Told you so"
