Well I met a pretty girl, as pretty as can be
I thought she was my baby till she introduced to me
A great big tall fella, about six foot tall
I shivered and I shook, couldn't do any more.

Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed, built for speed, built for speed, oh yeah.

Well some people think I'm lazy but there's one thing they don't know
Cause when I'm in the mood I can go caddy go.

Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed, built for speed, built for speed, oh yeah.

Well I can roar like a lion, I can sting like a bee
But sometimes I think baby, I've got rabbit blood in me.

Cause I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
Yes I'm a lover not a fighter
And I'm really built for speed, built for speed, built for speed, oh yeah.
