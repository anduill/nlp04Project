I really try my best
To give you
Whatever you demand
I'm your friend
I'll pass your test
I really try my best
To treat you
Not like anyone
But much better
Than the rest

You give me what I need
You dress me when I bleed
You cheer me when I'm blue
I feel your love is true

I'll never give away
Your sweet heart
That's beating in your chest
You do me good
Whatever you say
I'll never turn away
From you
The yearning inside gets worse
And it grows
Day by day

You give me what I need
You dress me when I bleed
You cheer me when I'm blue
I feel your love is true
