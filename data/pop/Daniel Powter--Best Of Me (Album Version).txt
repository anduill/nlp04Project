I was made the wrong way
Won't you do me the right way
Where you gonna be tonight
Cause I won't stay too long

Maybe all the life for me
When you talk to me it strikes me
Won't somebody help me
Cause I don't feel too strong

Was it something that I said?
Was it something that I did?
Or the combination of both that did me in?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't want to be there
when there's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't want to be there
When there's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought of finally being erased
Baby that's the best of me

Everything's behind you
But the hopeless stands beside you
Forever, never a moment
Have I wasted all your time

Was it something that I said?
Was it something that I did?
Or the combination of both that did me in?

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't want to be there
when there's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't want to be there
When there's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought of finally being erased
Baby that's the best of me yeah
Baby that's is the best of me

You know I'm hoping you'll sing along
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't want to be there
When there's nothing left to say

You know that some of us spin again
And when you do you need a friend
Don't want to be there
When there's nothing left for me

And I hate the thought of finally being erased
Baby that's the best of me
