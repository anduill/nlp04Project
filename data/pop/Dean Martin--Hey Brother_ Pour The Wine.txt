Here we sit enjoying the shade
Drink the drink that I have made
Tell you why the day is sunny
I'm in love with lips of honey
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

She is coming here to stay
I have waited for the day
She writes of love in every letter
Others have tried but I will get her
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

What is life
What is loving
What are all the stars that shine
Love my friend is everything
And love will soon be mine

Pour it quickly as you can
Pour it quickly once again
She's here at last my one and only
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine

Blink your eyes and love has passed
Hers was never made to last
She introduced me to another
No my friends, he's not her brother
I will miss the way she walks
Hey brother pour the wine
Hey brother pour the wine
