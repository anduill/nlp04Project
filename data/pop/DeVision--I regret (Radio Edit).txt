Sometimes I'm simple minded

Then I can't read your look

All my thoughts are binded

I'm like an opened book

In which you read the story

Of a bleeding soul

I am so sorry

Each time I lose control


I should suppress my rage

In need you beside me

Don't you leave the stage

I need you to guide me

I know you'll be my saviour

If I repeat my fault

You put me on my best behaviour

You hear my call


Please hold out

I regret

All the nasty words I said

I can feel you getting colder

Please don't doubt

That I regret

All the days I left you sad

Can't you see me getting older


I know I hurt your feelings

But you had the strength

To start my healing

You went all length

The days of crying

Have reached the end

'cause now I'm trying

To understand


Please hold out...
