speechless and fearful
suffocated by air
escaped from your grasping
I couldn’t stay there

one single day longer
now that I had
exposed what your facades
and walls didn’t say

Attracted by wisdom
and seductive psalms
I followed your footsteps
wherever I was

Talking by glances
people stay dumb
hostile words getting
even meaner like this

your lap offered comfort
deliverance your touch
divine and indulgent
you hurt me so much

I woke up but it was
already too late
I said if I shall die
please never here

Leaving I may be
while knowing for sure
Soon I will be with you...
...again
