How many can you love?
How many can you swallow?
How high do I have to fly
To reach your nest?
In the wintertime, they disappear too soon
And in the summertime, well I'll always be true

I need another, don't you want one too?
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you
'Cos I want another

How many can I love?
How many can I go with?
All my love is emptiness
When you're not around

So when the stranger comes she loves me only
But it's never real
It's just the wintertime you disappear
So cold is how I feel

I need another, don't you want one too?
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you
'Cos I want another

The morning came and the birds sang the song all fresh and blue
Sadness flows for the girl that I left
I came fumbling for you
Looking for you

In the summertime, well I'll always be true
I need another, don't you want one too?
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you
'Cos I need another, just like I need you
'Cos I want a lover, don't you want one too?
'Cos I need another, don't you want one too?
'Cos I want a lover, just like I need you
