[Verse 1]
I just want to be somebody's everything
You say I've seen too many movies, watched too much TV
Read too many fairy tales that I live and make believe
You say the kind of love I'm dreaming of does not exist
And there's no one like I'm searching for, well, I believe there is

[Chorus]
And I want someone to come alive when they lay eyes on me
Have a lust within their touch, a passion fire beyond belief
Reality and fantasy should be one in the same
And I want to be somebody's everything

[Verse 2]
I refuse to settle for something less than great
And if it takes a lifetime, then that's how long I'll wait
Cause all I want is everything, is that too much to ask?
Have romance, love and passion; find magic that will last

[Verse 3]
And I want someone to think they'll die if they can't be with me
I want to be their joy, their pride, their dreams
The very air they breathe
I want to wake up feeling loved and go to bed the same
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything, somebody's everything

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Someone to hold me close and tremble when the loving's done
Think it's heaven, call me angel, think I hung the moon and sun
Get misty eyed just knowing with a love song people sing
Yes, I want to be somebody's everything
And I'm gonna be somebody's everything, somebody's everything

[Verse 5]
I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I want to be, I want to be somebody's everything
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Somebody's everything, somebody's everything
Yes I want to be, I'm gonna be somebody's everything
I want to be, I'm gonna be, I wanna be somebody's everything
