I saw Jesus and the Devil they looked just the same
I saw Jesus and the Devil they looked just the same
And folks were willing to follow, but no one came
We were willing to follow but they looked just the same

I felt Jesus and the Devil, could not tell 'em apart
I felt Jesus and the Devil, could not tell 'em apart
I heard a knockin' on the door "Let me into your heart"
But it mighta been the Devil, he is awfully smart

I saw Jesus walk on water but I coulda been wrong
I saw Jesus walk on water but I coulda been wrong
And if I really saw it then I'll sing 'em this song
But I got to be sure, because, his road, it is long

I saw the Devil in the Garden, he was bringing Good News
I saw the Devil in the Garden, he was bringing Good News
He told me I could be in charge and then he brought me a noose
I put it right around my neck, I thought I'd wear it (just loose)

And then I tried to get on track again, I tried to be good
I tried to get on track again, I tried to be good
I was looking for the answers, I was reading The Book
But I couldn't find the answers, though try, as I would

I talked to Jesus and the Devil, they talked just the same
I talked to Jesus and the Devil, they talked just the same
And if God is really Good, the Devil, he knows His game
I talked to Jesus and the Devil, they talked just the same
