Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can

(just try)
Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement
To someone whos lost the way
(just try)
Or would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you
To share a problem that's not your own
We can change things if we start giving
Why don't you

Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can

(just try)
If you see an old friend on the street
And he's down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
(just try)
Try a little kindness you'll see
Its something that comes very naturally
We can change things if we start giving

Why don't you
Reach out and touch
Why don't you (why don't you)
Reach out and touch somebodys hand

Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
Reach out and touch
Somebodys hand
Make this world a better place
If you can
