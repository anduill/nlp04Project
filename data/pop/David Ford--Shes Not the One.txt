Holy cow, I need to get my shit together cos
She's not the one for me
She's gonna take my hand and drag me into stormy weather cos
She's not the one for me

She's got big ideas, some of the ugliest you'll ever know
She's not the one for me
Got me bad '79, '83 and '87, ah
She's not the one for me
Hey hey

I cannot live without her now
I just can't imagine someone else instead
I know that she's no good for me, ah
But she's all in my head

One of these days I know she's going to end up killing me
She's not the one for me
She's got a perfect smile, it's all yellow teeth and villainy
She's not the one for me

Total strangers tell me "she's up to something kid, I'm warning you"
She's not the one for me
I don't trust that funny little man from California
She's not the one for me
Hey hey

I just cannot be without her now
I just can't imagine someone else instead
I know that she's no good for me, ah
But she's all in my head, hey

Sha-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
She's not the one for me
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
She's not the one for me
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
She's not the one for me
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
She's not the one for me
