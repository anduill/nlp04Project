Look at me now, see where I've been
It ain't very pretty down on bitter end
The one I was for just wasn't for me
She, she thought she could steal love that belonged to me.

And if that's your belief
Then you're no better than a common thief, uh huh
If that's your belief
You're no better than a common thief, uh huh.

Look at me now, don't turn away
You see I'm the same as I was just the other day
I was for you but you just used me
You thought you could steal love that belonged to me.

And if that's your belief
Then you're no better than a common thief, uh huh
If that's your belief
Then you're no better than a common thief, uh huh.

Look at me now, see where I've been
It ain't very pretty down on bitter end
The one I was for, well, she just wasn't for me
She thought she could steal love that belonged to me.

And if that's your belief
Then you're no better than a common thief, alright
If that's your belief
You're no better than a common thief, uh huh.
