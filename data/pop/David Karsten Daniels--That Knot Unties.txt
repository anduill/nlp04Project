If you close your eyes, do you See any sky?
If you close your eyes, can you Make out any skies?

Is there a sky when that knot, that knot unties? 
As you close your eyes.

When you close your eyes, will you step Into the skies?
As you close your eyes, do you step Into the skies? 

Is there a sky When that knot, That knot unties?
As you close your eyes.

When you close your eyes, I will resist, I will not cry.
When you close your eyes, I can't resist, I will not cry.
I will not try, To know why.
To know why.
Why all things stop, die, die, die.
