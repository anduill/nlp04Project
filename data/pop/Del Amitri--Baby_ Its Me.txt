Who's gonna call you up every single day? 
Who's gonna hold you hard when stuff gets ugly? 

Cause baby if you wanna find someone 
As big as a door that fits in your palm 
A wall of support as small as a gun 
Can't you see? 
Baby it's me 

Who's gonna miss you just cause you leave the room? 
Who's gonna kiss your brow when your dreaming haunts you? 

Cause baby if you wanna find someone 
With all that they need but nothing they want 
Full of themselves but with a hole where you aren't 
Can't you see? 
Baby it's me 

Baby it's me 

Living in the lining 
Where your coins are chiming 
When we drive at night it's my eyes you're shining 

Who's gonna call you up every single day?
Can't you see 
Baby it's me
