With time to kill and an empty tomb, I
always find a way to pass the time with you
Dark and smokey room
I can hardly stand the fumes
Telling me that you mean no harm, you
stand me up like a crutch, another arm
But only when I'm gone
Have I been away too long?

NO
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
You'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Any given time or place, I
never will forget the disgrace on
your face so full of love
Will it ever be enough?
Ten feet tall and bullet proof, I
never thought that I had a thing to lose

Well it looks like after all
I'm gonna have to choose

NO
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
You'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

You help pass the time but I'm doing fine on my own
So there's no good reason why to live such a lie
Tell me have I been gone away too long

NO
You don't belong to me
I think you lied to me
And with my back against this wall, its hard to be strong
You'd tell me anything
Look what you've done to me
And still I tell myself that tomorrow you'll be long gone

Long gone
