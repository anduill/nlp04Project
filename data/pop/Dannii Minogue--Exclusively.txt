Hold me tight, laying next to you
Every kiss says something new
Every breath, deeper than before
Making me want you more

All I know is, baby, it feels so fine
So special, will you really be mine?
Hold on tight to this love tonight
Don't let go

You've got to give me your love exclusively
Don't share it with nobody else
Got to have your love exclusively
Here I am, understand all woman

All woman
All woman

Won't hold back anything from you
If we find this love is true
Wanna know where this love will go
I'm leaving it up to you

All I know is, baby, you feel so fine
So special, will you really be mine?
Hold on tight to this love tonight
Don't let go

You've got to give me your love exclusively
Don't share it with nobody else
Got to have your love exclusively
Here I am understand, all woman

All woman
All woman
