Ghosts, walk through the walls
They catch your rise and falls
Then sink back to sleeping, again
And dust, it settles on shelves
Will you shake me from myself
And tell me I'm alright?
And all the time on your own
The flowers have grown
Under your feet
And don't, don't you think that it's time
You said, "Hey, this one is mine"
Maybe do what you want to do?
'Cos you, well yo are no fun
And I'm so dumb
But please let us not be lonely, again
And you, you wear your mistakes
And I know mine
But please let us not be lonely, this time
Cheer up, you miserable fuck
This has gone on long enough
And I don't want to hear anymore
'Cos it you wait for the day
You find your thinking bends to straight
You'll be waiting for a long, long time
Oh you, well you are no fun
And I'm so dumb
But please let us not be lonely, again
And you, you wear your mistakes
And I know mine
But please let us not be lonely, this time
Well this house, it creaks in the night
When I turn out all the lights
There's nobody else around
And ghosts, they walk through the walls
They catch your rise and falls
And sink back to sleep, again
Oh you, well you are no fun
And I'm so dumb
But please let us not be lonely, this time
