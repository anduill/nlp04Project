[Intro]
Dear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free[x2]

[Chorus][x2]
I can walk down the street
There's no one there
The pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
My eyes can't see
But my mind wants to cry out loud
I feel free

[Outro][x3]
Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free
