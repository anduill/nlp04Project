Won't you surrender 
If you surrender 
I'll never let you go not even for a moment 
Won't you surrender to me 
And please be tender to me 
Because I need you so 

Time is swiftly flying 
Please don't leave me sighin' 
There's no denying 
That I'm longing to enfold you in my tender arms and hold you tight 

I feel temptation 
And facination 
Whenever you are near 
You're all that I dersire 
My lips are burning for you 
My heart is yearning for you 
Won't you surrender dear 

Time is swiftly flying 
Please don't leave me sighin' 
There is no denying 
That I'm longing to enfold you in my tender arms and hold you tight 

I feel temptation 
And facination 
Whenever you are near 
You're all that I dersire 
My lips are burning 
My heart is yearning 
Won't you surrender dear
