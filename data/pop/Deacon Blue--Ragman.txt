offered her a roof
the rain had made it shine
offered her a song
wasn't really mine

i showed her all my things
she offered me belongings
she thought i was a ragman

she offered me possessions
i tied them in a knot
wrapped it in a note
kept it in my pocket

i showed her all my things
she offered me belongings
she thought i was a ragman
i came to her too soon
she should have had a ragdoll
and wound up with a ragman

wing and kites and wedding rings
all these charms i said i'd bring

i showed her all my things
she offered me belongings
she thought i was a ragman
baby you're a rich man
lost in a small world
looking for a ragdoll
wound up with a ragman
with a ragman
ragman
