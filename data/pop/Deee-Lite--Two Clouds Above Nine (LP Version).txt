Just good things today
Our love's so high
The needles off the dial
Like a happy tear in your eye
You can't hide the smile

Just good things today
I know I got mine
It's like two clouds above nine
The nth degree of love is in our mind
And we just chose the time

After the rain
I'm on my way to better days
And I must say
No puddle's splash keeps me away
After the rain
Rainbows find my pot of soul
I can't complain
I'm just in from the cold

(RAP)

After the rain
I'm on my way to better days
And I must say
No puddle's splash keeps me away
Reflections I've seen
Like puddles mixed with gasoline
But I can't complain
I'm on my way to better days
Two clouds above nine
