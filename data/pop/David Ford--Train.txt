Well the sun's coming up, and the dust it is clearing 
Down the line I am hearing there's a train coming in 
I left my home and my girl, tried to find someplace better 
Oh but I never could forget her, so let this train take me home 

Oh please my darling forgive what I've done 
I've found nothing, just some big lonely world 
So take me back please my lover, take me back please my lover 
Took a train to discover I cannot be without you girl 

I was young, I was green 
Prone to foolish decisions 
At what I thought was ambition and a will to be free 

yeah but freedom's just some word 
Don't believe has a meaning 
So on this train I am leaving trying to get me back home 

CHORUS 

So pour another cup of coffee 
Pretty soon I'll be leaving 
I ain't done petty thieving 
Hitching rides and drinking beer 

And I'm so tired of having friends 
Just to keep out of prison 
Oh well this life really isn't all I hoped it would be 

CHORUS 

Took a train to discover I cannot a be without you girl
