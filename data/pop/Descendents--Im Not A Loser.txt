Think that I'm a loser,'cause my pants are really too low 
Think that I'm a slob, 'cause i got holes in my shoes 
Think my cock is like, just like my dirty shirt 
Well you can fuck off, 'cause i'm working sixty a week 
You think that life is really tough when your daddy won't buy you a brand new car 
Take a girl out, she won't fuck you, you just bought her a gram of coke 
Spent all your money on shitty coke 
I'm not a loser!, that's right, I'm not a loser!, I'm not a loser! 
Cruise down the boulevard wasting mommy's gas while you're looking for some kicks on Friday night 
You're only goal in life is to smoke a joint and decide how you're gonna get laid tonight 
You are a fucking son-of-a-bitch, you arrogant assholes 
Your pants are too tight, you fucking homos 
You suck, Mr. Buttfuck, you don't belong here 
Go away, you fucking gay 
I'm not a loser!
