Will there come a day you and I can say 
We can finally see each other? 
Will there come a time we can find the time 
To reach out for one another? 

We've been travelin' in circles such a long, long time 
Tryin' to say hello, hello! 
And we can just let it ride, but you're someone that I'd 
Like to get to know 

[Chorus:] 
I'll meet you halfway, that's better than no way 
There must be some way to get it together 
And if there's some way, I know that some day 
We just might work it out forever 

Will there come a day (Will there come a day) 
You and I can say (You and I can say) 
We can finally see each other? 
Will there come a time (Will there come a time) 
We can find the time (We can find the time) 
To reach out for one another? 

I'll meet you halfway, that's better than no way 
I'll meet you halfway, that's better than no way
