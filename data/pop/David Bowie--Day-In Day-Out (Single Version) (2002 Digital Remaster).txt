[Chorus]
Day In, Day Out
Stay In, Fade Out
Day In Oh Oh
Day Out Oh Oh Oh

[Verse 1]
She was born in a handbag
Love left
On a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Going to find her some money, honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
First thing she learns is
She's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Something rings a bell
And it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
She could use a little money
She's hanging on his arms
Like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey
She's on the other side
Oh come on little baby
Late night, big town
Police, shake down

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 4]
She's got a ticket to nowhere
She's going to take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name
She's in the pocket of a home boy
Oh she's going to take her a shotgun, Pow
Spin the grail spin the drug
She's going to make them well aware
She's an angry girl

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shooting her down
Shooting her with video, drugs, bullets and promises
