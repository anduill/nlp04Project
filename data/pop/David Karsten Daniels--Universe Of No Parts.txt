singing, getting sung
Things and Man are one
spinning, getting spun around
father as to son
God and Man as one
Infinite and then you choose

close your eyes to see
infinite, it be
open them but see just one
then you make your choice
choose to hear one voice
gamble it and then you lose

no angels without blame
lovers, traitors: same
(reminding me) for you I never came, to claim
on a lonely sun
nothing can be done
I can only burn for you
