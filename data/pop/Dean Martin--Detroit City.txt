I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Last night I went to sleep in Detroit city
And I dreamed about those cotton fields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long.

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit city
From the letters I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines.

You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
After all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride put on a southbound freight and ride
And goin' back to the loved ones the ones I left there waiting so far behind.

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home.

(I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home...)
