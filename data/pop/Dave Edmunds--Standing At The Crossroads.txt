Iâ€™m standing at the crossroads again
With an empty heart and a dollar ten
Maybe I'll bump into some famous names
Like Robert Johnson or Elmore James
Standing at the crossroads again

Well, I woke up this morning like I usually do
My baby was nowhere around
I looked in the kitchen, I looked in the hall
In my slippers and dressing gown

There were lipstick traces on the bedroom door
'Goodbye' she wrote, I don't want you no more
I guess, I ain't the man she was looking for
But just the man she found

Standing at the crossroads again
With an empty heart and a dollar ten
Maybe I'll bump into some famous names
Like Robert Johnson or Elmore James
Standing at the crossroads again

So, here I am on my own again
Where did I go wrong this time?
I feel like good, like a gentleman should
I never ever step out of line

You know that I'm no kid, I know my way around
Six feet tall, a hundred and sixty pound
I can't hold no romance down
Maybe I should give up trying

Standing at the crossroads again
With an empty heart and a dollar ten
Maybe I'll bump into some famous names
Like Robert Johnson or Elmore James
Standing at the crossroads again

Standing at the crossroads again
Standing at the crossroads again.
