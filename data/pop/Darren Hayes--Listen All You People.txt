Listen all you people
All you lonely and deserted
The departed
And the broken-hearted
I´ve got time for you
You can call your friends
For we´re headed on a journey

All the lonely
The mad
All the bad
Hold a sec
I´ve got a message for you

Nothing´s peaches and cream
Nothing´s quite what it seems
They´ve been lying to you

All you unhappy wives
All you pregnant brides
All you geeks
And you queens
All you sick
And you poor
All the drunks
On the floor
Well, I´m calling to you

Listen all you people
All you lonely and deserted
The departed
And the broken-hearted
I´ve got time for you
You can call your friends
For we´re headed on a journey
We´ve been held down
We´ve been pushed down now
We´re through

All the freaks
All the queers
All the thumbs
All the steers
Well it´s time to give in
There´s crack in the door
It´s okay to want more
You´ve been dying for years
All the races you lost
All the loveless that cost you
The hard earned sleep
All the stifled reactions
The screams you been acting
Like no one can hear you

Listen all you people
All you lonely and deserted
The departed
And the broken-hearted
I´ve got time for you

Sending out a message
Gotta get to you
Sending out a message
Is it coming through

(Sending out a message
Gotta get to you
Sending out a message
Is it coming through)

Listen all you people
All you lonely and deserted

Listen all you people
All you lonely and deserted
We´ve been held down
We´ve been pushed down now
We´re through

Listen all you people
Are you lonely and deserted?
