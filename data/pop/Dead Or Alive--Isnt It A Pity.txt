[Intro Excerpted Voice]
(I must admit we do get along, he's quite a man! 
No saint of course, but you must have expected that before you married him.
Maybe that was why you married him...)

[Verse 1]
I'm a kind of hybrid of a cartoon and a feature,
Some have thought me lovely, others saw an ugly creature.
Some have thought me right at times and others found me tired,
And I couldn't count the times that my backside has been admired.

[Bridge]
Beauty is glitter in my eyes,
I really wanted roses but you sent me custard pies.

[Chorus]
Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world, sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun,
I'm the loveliest one.

Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world? But sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun,
I'm the loveliest one.

[Verse 2]
I'm a kind of cross between a pupil and a teacher,
Some have found me lovely, others saw an ugly creature.
I have found my image has obscured all that I am,
But who said you can't mix vinegar with jam?

[Bridge]
Beauty is glitter in my eyes,
I really wanted roses but you sent me custard pies.

[Chorus]
Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world? But sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun,
I'm the loveliest one.

Isn't it a pity that I'm not the prettiest girl in the world, sometimes I feel when I
Kick up my heels in the sun,
I'm the loveliest one.

[Breakdown]
Isn't it a pity (the London image makers...
Face is made for mirror breakage,
You know their magazines 
Can not affect my self esteem!)

Beauty...
