So you want me to play the bleeding role
Just so he can know, how I needed you
Well, that's okay with me, it's a part I think I know
God knows, he won't need to suspend belief
I know it's just a game and losing you's
How it just begins ain't that a funny way to win?
Ain't that a funny way to win?
So I run around dragging people down
Holding my broken heart like a cheap cartoon
Just so he can see it's a sucker who
Does to you what you did to me
I know it's just a game and losing you's
How it just begins ain't that a funny way to win?
Yeah, that's a funny way to win
So if there's another need that I can still serve
I'm low on self-esteem but I'm high on nerve
I know it's just a game and losing you's
How it just begins ain't that a funny way to win?
(Losing you's)
Ain't that a funny way to win?
(Losing you's)
Yeah, that's a funny way to win
