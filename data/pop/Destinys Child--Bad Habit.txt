How many times
Are you gonna apologize about the same thing
And how many times can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong
(When I'm not the one that's doin' wrong, no)
I thought, maybe, if I started prayin'
Then we would get better, but
When I would pray, the answer would always come
Back to me, bein' done
But we're so hard-headed
When we're in love

So I...

[chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change
There's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me

And everytime that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But, I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

I'm totally out of my element
Learnin' new ways to live
While you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinkin' (you couldn't think about me)
To call me, when I get mad, you buy me gifts
Thinkin' it's gonna solve every issue

From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw (ya know I saw0
And everytime you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've taken all I can take (I've taken all I can take)
But, the way I live has gotta change, oh

[chorus]

Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody
So much, that you was just too blind to see
Past all of the pain they was causin' you (causin' you)
Ladies, do you feel me (do you feel me)

Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right thing that you should do
Oh, then it's time to make a change (time to make a change)

[chorus]
