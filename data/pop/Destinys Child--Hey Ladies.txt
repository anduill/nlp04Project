(CHORUS)
Hey ladies !
Why is it that
men can go do us wrong?
Why is it that
we just decide to keep holdin on?
Why is it that
we never seem to just have the strength to leave?
Well he's got to go
He got to go

(Verse 1)
My mans been cheatin on me
Been runnin round here with this little
Tenderoni
And don't think I haven't noticed
He's been actin funny
Takin to long to call me
And somebody told me
That the worst thing of it all
is that he gave her money
Now how he gonna give her my ends thats a NO NO
My first reactions tellin me
He's got to GO GO
but i just aint
for sure
Should I just let him go
ooh i don't know

Yeah he did me wrong
but I love him so
I keep holding on
But he got to go
He's got to go
Thought he was the one
But now i dont know
After what he's done
He's got to go
He's got to go

(CHORUS)
(Verse 2)

Keep rewindin it
Stoppin it and playin yourself
Over again
See I'm sick and tired
of you doin the same old thing
sick of your same routine
Now you got to come clean
Cause it's killin me

Yeah he did me wrong
but I love him so
I keep holdin on
But he got to go
He's got to go
Thought he was the one
But now i dont know
After what he's done
He's got to go
He's got to go

(CHORUS)

(bridge)
I just don't understand
You get chance after chance
and you say that you'll do right
But I really do not know
if you can
it's not in your plans that you've shown
can you change?
don't think so
now i got to let you go

OoOoOoOOooOOooommmm

Got to go go go go goooo
Got to go go, go go goooooo

(CHORUS till end)

Thou shall move on to the next
