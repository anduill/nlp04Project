There are some things you can't cover up
With lipstick and powder
Thought I heard you mention my name
Can't you talk any louder

Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer
Oh, I just wanna hear girls talk

Got a loaded imagination bein' fired by girls' talk
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls' talk
But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, right here

And now, girls talk
And they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
If they say that it's so
Don't they think that I'd know by now

Got the word up on everyone's lipstick
That you're getting faded
You may not be an old-fashioned girl
But you're gonna get dated

Was it really murder, were you just pretending
Lately I've heard you are the living end

Girls talk, and they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
And they think they know how girls talk
If they say that it's so
Don't they think that I'd now by now

But I can't say the words you wanna hear
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear, I hear

There are some things you can't cover up
With lipstick and powder
But I heard you mention my name
Can't you talk any louder

Don't come any closer, don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't come any clearer

Girls talk, and they wanna know how girls talk
And they say it's not allowed, girls talk
And they think they know how girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Girls talk, girls talk
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah girls talk
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah girls talk
