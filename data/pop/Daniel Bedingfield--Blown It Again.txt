I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again

Finally I'm seeing clearly 
I'm writing this so you can hear me
How did I get it in my head that you could do me wrong? No.
Since I got to know you better 
I found that I was glad I met ya
Why did I listen to those lies when you were standing there for me?

Why did I never tell you? Why did I not say? Why did I push it away?
Why did I never trust ya? I could have told you all my fears
All those years, now I'm ashamed of my ways 

I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it, it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again

Diggin' up the heart within me 
Dismay is the only feeling I see
I have to say my heart ain't what it could be 
Open up the box and tell me what it should be
You can't free you boot if it ain't gone fly 
You can't live a life if you don't ask why
Such a thing as too much information, trapped inside this condemnation.

Why did I never tell you? Why did I not say? Why did I push it away?
Why did I never trust ya? I could have told you all my fears 
All those years, now I'm ashamed of my ways

I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again

I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it 

Sorry, you said it, my motor mouth done and did it again, exceeding speed limit and now I'm
Feelin it.
I'm knee deep in it, ready to roll like a jeep with the keys in it, so give me three minutes.
'Cause I admit it, I was wrong with no right to expect, maybe you might just accept my apology
Even though it feels funny, 'cause when a penny dropped I'm like "Oh my gosh I killed Kenny!"
I can't believe I'd end up dissin' a friend, man I shoulda known better than to listen to them.
With their see through poisonous lies, deceitful, made you the last one on my list to speak to,
Yeah.
Sticks and stones break bones and kill. Word wounds take long to heal.
I was wrong for real and I ain't even gon' try to deny, 'cause I missed the mark and I missed
It wide.

I've done it I've blown it again
Gone and lost my one true friend
If I can't stop it it's gonna end
I've done it, I've blown it again
I've done it, I've blown it again
