Never let me go
love me much too much
if you let me go
life would loose its touch

what would I be with out you?
there's no place for me with out you

never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away 
there'd be a thousand hours in the day
without you I know

because of one caress my world was overturned
at the very start all my bridges burned
by my flaming heart
you'd never leave me would you
you couldn't hurt me could you 

never let me go 
please never let me

because of one caress my world was overturned
at the very start all my bridges burned by my flaming heart 
you'd never leave me would you
you couldn't hurt me could you?
never let me go 
never let me go
never...let me go...
