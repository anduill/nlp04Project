You're lucid as you've ever been
I wish you could quit the scene
You're suffering from the "L.I.S."
Imprisoned in a horrible dream

You cannot react physically
Such a trembling uncertainty
You're suffering from the "L.I.S."
Traumatic brain-injury

It's useless to get up a steam
Depend on life support machine
You're suffering from the "L.I.S."
"Living" - What does it mean?

Suffering
From the "Locked In Syndrom"
Suspended
In a deep black sea
Suffering
From the "Locked In Syndrom"
Blackout
Brain-injury
