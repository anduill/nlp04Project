Farewell my friends
Farewell my dear ones
Farewell this world
Forgive my weakness

Goodbye my friends
Goodbye to evening parties
Remember me
In the spring

To work for your bread
Soon you must leave
Remember your family
Work for your children

I don't need much
And the older I become
I realize
My friendships

Lord carry me over
Any course of distance
Any cause of sorrow

My friends that last
Will dance one more time
With me
I don't need much
This I need
