Welcome to hell! 

Sweating on the top line 
At the airline 
Check-in not check out 
Wish I could get the hell out 
This is no joke 
The thing could go up in smoke 
Or plummet to the ground 
As the G-force pulls us down 

Flight! Fright! Get uptight! 
Throw a seven in the clouds and 
Out go yer lights 
City to city! State to state! 
Roasting coast to coast 
In a megaton freight crate 

Hurtle down the runway 
Is it a one way trip to heaven 
Or hell on wheels? 
In a 747 I get a little freaky 
When there's only air and 
Steel beneath me 

"Fasten your seatbelt 
We hope you enjoy the ride." 

CHORUS 
Junk metal in the air! 
It's a total nightmare 
At 20,000 feet! 

Are ready for a rough ride? 
Tis could be suicide 
Turbulance ahead 
I think my lunch 
Is on the uprise! 
Far out! This dread ain't funky 
My hair's on end 
There's no blood left in me! 
It's not the car of the bus 
Or the train! It's the plane 

When we hit top speed 
It's always the same 
Sweating red hot 
But chilled to the bone 
Side to side 
Bouncing off the ozone 

Tranquilise me! Hypnotise me! 
Technofear haz paralyzed me 
All around me people grinning 
Laughing while my head is 
Spinning 
Shakin' like a leaf 
From my head to my feet 
Strapped to a seat 
At 20,000 feet 

Safer in the air 
Than on the ground!
