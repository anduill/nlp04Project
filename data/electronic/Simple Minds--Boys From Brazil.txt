Boys from Brazil
Champagne
Desert shore

Celebrate, memorize
Associate lips with the poor
Eyes of the world on you
Eyes of the world on you

Boys from Brazil

What can you say
About anything lost now?
What can you say
About stolen things too?

Anything stolen
Something is lost now
What can you say
And how fast can things move?

Boys from Brazil
Fortune of bird in flight
Tycoons and whirlwind
Brings a hush on lover's voice
Eyes of the world on you
Eyes of the world on you

Babies cannot manage
Lust and ambition
Babies only speak and ingenious talk
Babies don't remember
Chance or up in shame
Babies cannot manage crocodiles

Boys from Brazil
Gentleman and adventure
Killing hearts and gentle life
Spending money in capitals
Eyes of the world on you
Eyes of the world on you

Boys from Brazil
Gentleman and adventure

What can you say
About anything lost now?
What can you say
About stolen things too?

Anything stolen
Something is lost now
What can you say
And how fast can things move?

Not just the boy, that's crying wolf now
Someone else is screaming up at our door
Not just a boy, that's crying wolf now
Someone else is screaming up at our door

Taking tracks back
Slip a while back
In forward moves

Boys taking tracks back
Slip a while
Forward moves, forward moves
Slip a while back
