man fell down from the sky
soul on fire
trying to save me from myself
take me higher than the dregs
and the ditches
and the slack-jacked bitches of bull and bear
could my brother be my own worst enemy?
unprepared,
no, i didn't make me ready
lived by rules
one set for you and one set for me

100 days.....
100 days.....

hunger after past,
keep on hankering
running behind the times fast as only you can
get a clue
take my hands or my coattails
I'm still falling
and I hit the ground struggling
midnight's doubt just keeps on bubbling up
still falling and I'm trying to say the words
but my thoughts run away with me

100 days
such a long road
100 days
