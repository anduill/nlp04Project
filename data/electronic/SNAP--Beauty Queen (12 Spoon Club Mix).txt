When I walked in the room 
I saw a note on the bed 
never to know what this note 
might have said 
I am ready to leave you baby 
I know that you love somebody else 
I thought that I was the one that you need 
How could she think something like this? 
How could it be that she is so pissed? 
I long to feel your happiness, 
I reminisce 
I put the note in my pocket 
out of the door like a rocket 
seventy five down to your girls pad 
Took the stairs to open the door 
never to know what was in store 
gave two knocks on the front door, 
then suddenly 
out of the blue your eyes appeared 
felt the pain, and its so clear 
that I am losing you 
If you love me, why don't you hug me? 
Why won't you squeeze me and tell me, 
you love me? 
I'm so lonely. 
why you ignore me? 
Thought I was the only one, 
thought I was your beauty queen. 
If you need me, 
tell me you need me. 
I'm really hungry for love, 
won't you feed me? 
It's raining, 
it's pouring. 
Thought I was the only one, 
thought I was your beauty queen. 
If you love me, why don't you hug me? 
Why won't you squeeze me and tell me, 
you love me? 
I'm so lonely. 
why you ignore me? 
Thought I was the only one, 
thought I was your beauty queen. 
If you need me, 
tell me you need me. 
I'm really hungry for love, 
won't you feed me? 
It's raining, 
it's pouring. 
Thought I was the only one, 
thought I was your beauty queen. 
beauty queen 
So I look in her eyes 
but there is no surprise 
I can feel the temperature rise 
??confident in what to do.. this time?? 
I know that I have been so wrong 
without you the day seems so long 
when the love is gone 
its gone and i feel like I could scream 
And I keep working, and I keep working 
my fingers to the bone 
but you're never home 
tell me when *will i see* this love 
I making it clear that I want you dear 
if you want a ride common baby get in 
lets ride into the sunset 
she said ?.........? 
that you'll never ever ever see me again 
I got to get you 
what's the issue 
but ?...? need to get you 
she kept scream and scream 
that you'll never ever ever see me again 
that you'll never ever ever see me again 
that you'll never ever ever see me again 
that you'll never ever ever see me again
