Stone cold sober
How can I hide?
I can’t go to work today
Lord, oh Lord, what have I done?
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum

Things ain’t what they used to be
Makes no difference to me
Your words came through, my time has come
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum
24 hours in a day
I can’t keep going in this way
Got no choice, just got to run and run
Just wanna know I can dream of a rising sun

Do do do do do do do
Woowoowoowoowooooh (etc)

I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum (Ah!)
I will dance to the beat of a different drum

Shade your eyes it’s getting bright
Don’t look down; I know you’re scared of heights
Bit by bit we’ll overcome (bit by bit we’ll overcome)
I wanna dance to the beat of a different drum
I look around, what do I see?
A thousand faces all staring at me
Lord, oh Lord, what have I done?
Just wanna show what we are, what we will become

I’m gonna dance to the beat of a different… drum, drum, drum
Ah, oh

I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum
I will dance to the beat of a different drum (Ah!)
I will dance to the beat of a different drum (wanna dance to the beat of a different drum)

Do do do do do
Woowoowoowoowooooh (etc)

I’m gonna dance to the beat of a different… drum
Drum

Just wanna make a change
Just wanna make a change
Do it a little different
Just wanna make a change
Do it a little different
Than yesterday
