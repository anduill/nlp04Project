Sometimes I feel really glad
Looking back at the fun we've had
But sometimes I want so much more
Than this tug of war
I'm longing for
Swinging scenes in magazines
They're just distant dreams now

Some say it feels really bad
When those vicious tongues, begin to wag
But somehow all those paper lies
Just anaesthetise the passers by
The faceless clowns that put me down
Don't bring me down 

I'm lost inside this brain drain
Taking me over
Somehow, I get to play the fame game
Lost inside this brain drain
I used to long for

A call to action, a strange attraction

Somehow I'm not ready for
Feeling bored and wanting more
The radio plays like a uniform
And dips you brains in chloroform
They're so concerned
The spoken word
Seems so absurd

I'm lost inside this brain drain
Taking me over
Somehow, I get to play the fame game
Lost inside this brain drain
I used to long for

A call to action, a strange attraction
It's never the way it goes
Just in time, too late to know

I've realised
I'm lost inside
I'm mesmerised
I'm lost inside this brain drain
Taking me over 
Somehow, I get to play the fame game
Lost inside this brain drain
I used to long for
