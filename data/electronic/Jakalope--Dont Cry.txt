This is anything but fair
Don't say that it's not cause
You get what you want
And I
While I don't want this situation

Don't tell anyone that
This is
This
This is
What I've found
I'm surrounded
Don't tell anyone that
This is
This
This is
Where I'm found
I'm so surrounded

And I
Oh I believe
It's never too late
To be where I have been
And I think we
We are meant to be
We are meant to

I've been here somewhere before
Covered in frustration
But
Still I've lost me somewhere
And I don't want this situation

Don't tell anyone that
This is
This
This is
What I've found
I'm surrounded
Don't tell anyone that
This is
This
This is
Where I'm found
And I am done
