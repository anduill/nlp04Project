I can't slip my skin, I'm full of dust, I'm chemically imbalanced
I'm cancer, bad astrology's the answer

If I were a child again, I'd be holy and not insane
I've got the tear, I can't get out of the void into the light
Out of the void into the light

I'm scarecrow man, I'm made of rags and straw
I'm paranoid, I can't see or feel or speak, I lust hang

I'm so tired I can't sleep, I'm so hungry I can't eat
I've got the fear, I can't get out of the void into the light
Out of the void into the light
If I were a child again, I'd be holy and not insane
I've got the fear, I can't get out of the void into the light
Out of the void into the light
