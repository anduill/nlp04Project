Is that you doing that to me
With your stare
I feel the temperature start to rise
And I
Really take it from there

I start to press my skin to you
I'm craving it
I'm feeling you
Will you relieve me fast
Feast your eyes on my display
Take control
Fall over me
Cover me in ecstasy

Let me ride to heaven
Let me feel the swelling
Oh let me concentrate

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me baby
Oh oh oh

Now's the time for you to let go of
All your inhibitions
We can do this one more time
With a little
Tease and conversation

Watch the way my body moves
Feel the rhythm melting you
Mmm this is how it should be
Crawl over you
I'll dominate
Your destiny
I'll be your faith
I will be your fantasy

Let me ride to heaven
Let me feel the swelling
Oh let me concentrate

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me oh baby
Oh oh oh

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me baby
Oh oh oh

If I've fallen in love with the soul
If I've fallen in love with myself
I'll take it all in one time

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me baby
Oh

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me baby
Oh oh oh
