Oh...

I'm chasing defeat
Self created- misery
Where will this end
Where did it begin
I won't lie down
I'm already- down
I rest my step and fall
Into the hole

[Chorus]
I've closed my eyes
Not even the start
To rest my head- so far
Nothing, nowhere but emptiness

Oh...

Tears of dust burn me
I'm so tired- and weary
I've put my feet down
Firmly- on the ground
There's no way to overcome
What I've- done
I've missed my step and lost all control

[Chorus]

Oh, oh
