Why does this man defy the storm and burn us all
Each time his hand waves
The sun, it sets on lonely graves

Haven't we read this page before
They gonna lose the war
Put down the glory flag
Nothing will be the same

This is the world he wants
Pray for the brave and the young
It won't bring them back again

Stillness, you know that it brings
supreme and suffocates our only dream
No birds sing here, they're flown away
They didn't even say when they'd be back again
Will they come back again?

Unleash the hounds of hell
With all the stormy wind
Heaven inside his storm

This is the world he wants
Pray for the brave and the young
He knows they're not coming home
Now do you ever, ever get the feeling
Ever get the feeling this is the world that he wants

You ever get the feeling, ever get the feeling
This is the world that he wants
This is the world he wants
This is the world he wants
