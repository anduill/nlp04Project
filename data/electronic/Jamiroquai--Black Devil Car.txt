I've got a lot of juice
I need to put to use
Lets bring this highway down
I'm going from z to g
When it should be a to b
nose so low it just scrapes the ground
Can't you see me overtaking
All the while im salivating
Won't you let me
Push a little thrust up you

she loves

Chorus
Riding around 
In my black devil car
I can't hear a sound
Because her foot's pushing down too hard
And white angels cry
For her black devil heart
She wants me to stop
She should never let me start
She should never let me start

Talking to all those pretty girls
That i meet around the world
Her name was Gina
You should have seen her
She had the greenest eyes
And with those endless thighs
I've put my hands through
Some misdemeanors 
Can't you see me
I'm not choosy
You drive a black machine
And i think your groovy
Won't ya let me 
Take a little ride with you

Chorus x1

She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
She's just a love machine
Ooooooh, riding around 
In my black devil car
You know i can't hear a sound
In my black devil car
Yeah

Babe you know

Your such a tight machine
Now let me drive your dream
Until you tank is dry
I'm shooting from the hip
Not running out of clips
Flames of love and licking high
You know she'll always be running free
A hot freewheeling, honey bee
Won't ya let me
Push a little thrust up you
Thats what i wanna do

Chorusx1

Strapped down, wrapped around, breaking up the speed limits 
Red lights, crazy nights, hope she's comeing back with it
Super charged devil queen, stepping in my love machine
Twisted my metal on the highway of desire
She's easy ridin' super flyin', 95 it's still green
High heels shiny wheels looking for a tight squeeze
rocket fuel and jet juice now she's getting real loose
Can't stop, black heart, she should never let me start

She's just a love machine
