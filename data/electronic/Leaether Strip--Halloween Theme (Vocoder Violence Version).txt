Michael lurks in our darkness
In the shadows of the night
Waiting for the perfect moment
Waiting for his chance to strike

Michael is in all of us
That's why he can never die
He was made by cruel abuse
Michael seeks revenge tonight

Michael Myers lives in you
Michael Myers lives in me

Michael's gonna cut you up
