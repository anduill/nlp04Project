Further into the fog I fall
Well, I was just following you

When you said do as I do and scrap your fey ways
Dial a cliche
Grow up, be a man and shut your mealy mouth
Dial a cliche, dial a cliche

But the person underneath, where does he go?
Does he slide by the wayside or just die?
And you find that you've organized your feelings for people
Who didn't like you then and don't like you now

Yet you say do as I do and scrap your fey ways
Dial a cliche
Grow up, be a man and shut your mealy-mouth
Dial a cliche

The safe way is the only way
There's always time to change some
I've changed but I'm in pain
