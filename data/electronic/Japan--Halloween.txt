The cottage is windswept 
Now there's only sorrow here 
Follow evacuation signs 
You're detached and broken 
And so sentimental now 
Remembering how we passed our time 

Somebody waits for me 
Far beyond our halloween 

Germanic forces marching on concrete squares 
Our love is just defenceless sound 
And could we believe that all you said was true 
We would be so determined now 

Slowly emerging, dividing Germany 
Everyone's lost in East Berlin 
And only believing just what you want to here 
We're waiting at stations once again
