I married myself
I'm very happy together
I married myself
I'm very happy together

I married myself
I'm very happy together
Long, long walks on the beach, lovely times
I married myself, I'm very happy together
Candlelight dinners home, lovely times

This time it's gonna last, this time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever

I married myself
I'm very happy together
I married myself
I'm very happy together

This time it's gonna last, this time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
This time it's gonna last, this time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever

I married myself
I'm very happy together
Long, long walks on the beach, lovely times
I married myself, I'm very happy together
Candlelight dinners home, lovely times

This time it's gonna last, this time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
This time it's gonna last, this time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
