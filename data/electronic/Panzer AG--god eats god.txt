"The free world will conquer Communism
With the aid of God and with you Marines"

"God has a hard-on for Marines
Because we kill everything we see
He plays his games, we play ours"

We need the rain of blood
That comes with bombs

We need the pain of life
That comes with us

Fight fire with fire
Everything will burn
Fight fire with fire
Everything will burn

God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
Baby, burn

"Please God, stop this evil spirit
From invading my body and my mind
Please God, stop this evil spirit"

Come share our dream
It's not our fault
We're just machines
Designed to make a genocide
Designed to make a genocide

God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
God eats god
Everything will burn
Baby, burn

Fight fire with fire
Everything will burn
Fight fire with fire
Everything will burn
