Sometimes the comfort of a room
Sometimes I'm quite alone
I pack to leave a foreign town
It seems I'll never know

But I'll rent new accomodation
We'll make plans for mobile homes

Slow boats moving with the tide
Drifting far from shore
It's the nature of this country life
I've never known before
Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses
From mobile homes

Plant life
My life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life
My life
Still life in mobile homes

The sound of wildlife fills the air
So calm and dry
The bushland burns in this southern heart
Like an open fire

Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses
From mobile homes...mobile homes

Plant life
My life
Still life in mobile homes
Blood life
My life
Still life in mobile homes

A voice screams from heaven
As we start to sail
It's the calling of the fatherland
I used to know so well

But our age new accomodation
Will make plans for mobile homes

Plant life
My life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life
My life
Still life in mobile homes
