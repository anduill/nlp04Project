I destroy the past that makes you cold
And kill the demon of your raping soul
To stop the fears and to fight the voice
See through my eyes that you had no choice

I clean your mind to erase the fault
And heal the world of your crying soul
To be free from cares I kiss his mouth
And I drink the blood that runs out

I will release you from submission
To save you from confusion
I will release you from deception
To deliver you from hurt

I raise the dust that makes you blind
With velvet gloves I hold you tight
We draw the line there is nothing more
If darkness comes I will be your shore
