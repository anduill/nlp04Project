Power, energy
Controlling life, controlling people
Give me power, lots of it
To control my life, to control your life

Power

Power, coming from the speaker
Power, coming from the bass
Creating the future, creating machines
That's the power in your soul

Power

Power, of the human animal
Stripping away the skin, reaching down, down to the bone
Driving you upwards, driving you crazy
That's power

Power

Power, call of the wild
It's ringing in my nervous system, it's crawling up my spine
It's burning in my backbrain
It's gonna be mine, it's gonna be mine

Power
