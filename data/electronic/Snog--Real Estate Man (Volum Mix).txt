Get ahead, fall behind
That's the deal, never mind
Try to win, never can
It's because of the real estate man

March in time, stand in line
Yeah buddy, that's the crime
Try to live, never can
It's because of the bureaucrat man

Feel the teeth, in your neck
Bloodsuckers at you back
Suit and tie, and a six month plan
The disguise of the real estate man

Worthless money, that's the scam
Slave to your debt, slave to the man
Counterfeit if you can
To destroy, the real estate man
