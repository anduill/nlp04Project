It's time for the crying to stop
Cause I love you
It's time for you to grow up
I want you
And I need you

There's a hole in your soul
Where your heart used to me
All the doors are locked
And you can't find the key
There's fish in the sky
And there's birds in the sea
Cause you want me
And you need me

You're drowning from all of the tears in the sky
It's a bad dream
You can't even close your eyes
It's a bad dream
A bad dream

It's time for the pie in the sky
Cause I'm hungry
It's time for you to let it die
You're lonely
All alone

Tigers in their tanks struggle to get free
Skinny little dogs barking up the wrong tree
Snakes in the grass learn their ABCs
And you need me
And you want me

You're drowning from all of the tears in the sky
It's a bad dream
You can't even close your eyes
It's a bad dream
A bad dream

Screaming from a voice inside
Running but you cannot find
A place
To hide
From the bad dream

There's a hole in your soul
Where your heart used to me
All the doors are locked
And you can't find the key
There's fish in the sky
And there's birds in the sea
And you hate me
But you need me

You're drowning from all of the tears in the sky
It's a bad dream
You can't even close your eyes
It's a bad dream
A bad dream

Screaming from the voice inside
Trying to find a place
Inside
To hide
From the bad dream

The bad, bad
Bad, bad
Bad, bad
Dream
