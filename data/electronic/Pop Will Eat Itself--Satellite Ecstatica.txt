The day regurgitates at six pm on TV news
The fools, the clowns
End of the decade blues
The walls are crumbling
The fear should have a hold on me
But fate can wait
The time has come to get my due

Scratch like a vampire
Screaming like a maniac
Satellite ecstatica
Treat me to that heart attack

Do not panic

The door flies wide
A crunching blow hits from behind
I'm wet with sweat
And handcuffed to the TV set
She smiles the smile
Of someone in complete control
I'm on my knees
And beggin' her for mercy, please

Satellite ecstatica
Screaming like a maniac
Leisure inc fantasia
Heading for a heart attack

Do not panic
Do not panic
Do not panic

Her mischief is stirring
She's purring like a pussycat
The air is damp
As her hot breath is steaming out
She feeds me in 3D
We sync rhythmic intensity
I'll die in here
Her thighs shut tight around my ears

Do not panic
Do not panic

My teeth are clenched
The room spins round and then gets drenched
I'm through, destroyed
I spent it all, she looks annoyed
She slaps my face
I clear up so there is no trace
And back, I drift
To bedsit bliss, late TV shift

Satellite ecstatica
Screaming like a maniac
Bite like a vampire
Heading for that heart attack

Do not panic
Do not panic
Do not panic
Do not panic

It's got a hold on me, satellite
It's got a hold on me
It's got a hold on me, satellite
It's got a hold on me
It's got a hold on me, satellite
It's got a hold on me
It's got a hold on me, satellite
It's got a hold on me
