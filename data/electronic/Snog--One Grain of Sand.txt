I'm so jaded I can hardly speak
So weary can't lift my feet
So withered, it hurts to weep
But this thought I'll always keep

One grain of sand
One grain of sand
To build a mountain
By hand
You got to start with one
Grain of sand

The war machine so filled with hate
The money lies at every gate
So many battles to meet
People take to the streets

One grain of sand
One grain of sand
Every adventure
Every plan
Had to start with one
Grain of sand

I know it's easy just to sit and watch
Apathy is so easy to catch
Don't shake, I'm as guilty as you
But these words I know are true

One grain of sand
One grain of sand
Every adventure
Every plan
Had to start with one
Grain of sand

One grain of sand
Every adventure, every plan
Had to start with one
Grain of sand

One grain of sand
One grain of sand
To build a mountain
By hand
You've got to start with one
Grain of sand

One
One
One
One
One
One
One
One
