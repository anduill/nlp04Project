It's all right. 
It's all right. 
Let me go high. 
Let me go high. 

Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world. 

It's all right, it's ok 
To believe in something. 
You find the spark inside yourself. 
It begins from nothing, 
From the man of the cave 
To the soul of the brave, 
For the love of God. 
Let me go now. 

Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world. 

It's all right, it's ok 
To believe in something, 
But if it falls between ourselves 
Could kill like nothing. 
From the man of the cave 
To the soul of the brave. 
For the love of God, 
Let me close now. 

Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go by into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world. 
Let me go high into a different world.
