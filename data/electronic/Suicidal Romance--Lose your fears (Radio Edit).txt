When darkness calls your name
Fell the touch on your naked skin
Taking all the pain you had
So far away

When stars begin to shine your way
See how angels split the dark
To bring you in the faithful arms
Of your only one

We spread our wings we make our step
We want to be so near
And in this light we have a wish
We want to disappear

We close our eyes we take a chance
We want to fly away
And no more tears in our eyes
Tonight we lose our fears

Lose your fears

When rain begins to hide your tears
Hear his voice like in sweetest dream
And know that he is there with you
So near to you

When heart is rising beat
Fell his kiss on your tender lips
And falling to his lovely arms
You fly away
