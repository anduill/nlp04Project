Chorus: x2]
Another day, another way
For me to open up to you

I used to always... 
I would wake up all day
only to find there's nothing more to say

Now I'm letting silence to the talking
Now I'm letting silence to the walking

[Chorus: x2]

I used to scream when a whisper would do
Only wanted yours, all over you

Now I'm letting silence to the talking
Now I'm letting silence to the walking

[Chorus: x4]
