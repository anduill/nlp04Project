plants and rags ease myself into a body- bag 
dreamt a man he fed me fine food, he gave me shiny things

white and black are you looking for the sun boy? the sun doesn't shine down here, no, in shadow
house and home who thought they could take away that place? lead us outside, and lead us out quietly
