We've had a lot of good times brother
I've knows you all my life
Mixing blood and drugs and women
In your journey to the endless night
I've watched you kill the love you're given
You sold your vision for a glimpse of heaven

Once you were a thief of fire, now you're just a junkie liar
What you gonna cop when the bomb drops?

There's been a million people brother
Just like you before
Think you're beyond good and evil
You can't even find the door
Painting pictures on your wall in junkie blood
Hey man! Ain't that cool? It's so beautiful!

Once you were a thief of fire, now you're just a junkie liar
What you gonna cop when the bomb drops?

Ain't no medicine to cure you
Ain't no woman you can love
Only death can make you painless
Only death can make you come
Junkie Jesus on the cross, you beg for scraps like a mongrel dog

Once you were a thief of fire, now you're just a junkie liar
What you gonna cop when the bomb drops?
Drop the bomb, ah-ah, like the bomb

You shot the bullets from your gun, you're going down like a setting sun
You shot the bullets from your gun, you're going down like a setting sun
You shot the bullets from your gun, you're going down like a setting sun
You shot the bullets from your gun, you're going down like a setting sun
You shot the bullets from your gun, you're going down like a setting winter sun
