Are you happy now
That you're on your own?
Like a ghostly shadow
Is your heart like stone?

I'll make you feel whole
I'll make you feel whole
Cuz nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
But you
But us
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
But us
But us

Well the edge gets closer
You'll slip and fall
You'll lose your shadow
I'll hear you call
Body to body
Scratching claw
Cut so deeply
I'll hear you call
