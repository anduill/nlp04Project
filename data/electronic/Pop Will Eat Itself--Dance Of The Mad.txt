Get up! It's time!
Get up and make it snappy!

Dance like a psycho
A sight like nothing on earth
Keep a wide berth
From anyone you might know
So no first night nerves
All first serves! All aces!
Straight home bases

Sweating like a pig doing the jig
At the gig of the century
Because we'll never be
Told by the old school
Sold the old rules
Mad and bad to know
Tho' we're no fools

Downbeats down to earth
You down with me?
Clowning round the town
Step easy
cooking up new tricks
Looking for a new kick
Found a new sound
Found that it sticks

Heard about the bird
'Bout the plane and
The superman?
Word is: We can outlast anyone
Supercede the superfly guys
Who will concede
They are dying flies

This range of suss
Could be dangerous
Let's test! At best it's religious
At worst a thirst
Bursting for the next rhyme
all times sacred
Even stripped naked

This damned nation
Needing salvation
Reach out!
Teach in musical elation
Shout! Get out of it get within it
Get out of it get within it

DJ
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped
Playin it mad DJ! Playin it bad DJ
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped

All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way hyped
All the way
All the way mad
All the way hyped

Are you with me
Are you with it?

A musical nasty
Fast as it has to be
A catastrophe
Heavy duty chaos
'Cos I'm all attitude
The dude to kickstart
The party mood

Cue the truth:
Sleuths are never sober
The proof of youth
So move over rover
Hey! Disco King
You've stopped dancing

Best admit
This hit's an obsession
Lost in lust
Better listen to the lessons
Bright lights big city
Broad minds
Bored pretty easily

Busted just for justice sake
They can't control a soul
There's an outbreak
Of outrageous love
It's contagious,
It's here to save us

Some say:
"Now way DJ don't play
The latest and greatest
The mad and bad way."
If it ain't music use it abuse it
Call it a wall of noise
But don't refuse it

This damned nation
Needing salvation
Reach out!
Teach in musical elation
Shout! Get out of it, get within it
Get out of it, get within it

DJ
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped
Playin it mad DJ! Playin it bad DJ
All the way mad and bad
All the way hyped

Dedicated to all the bores
To all the whores
Who forced the laws
You thought we would stop dancing
But you were wrong

1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Kiss my ass and go to heaven
