Just because it's there
sit for hours and stare.
Tap your fingers to oblivion.
Bit by bit you fade
turns from color to grey.
Tap, tap, tap into another world

Just because it's there
you lose the people who care
and in the end they stop calling you.
You don't have to exist
to plug yourself into this.
Tap your fingers to oblivion

Sons and daughters, the ill and the blind
kiss(?) and thieves you're all out of mind.
Those at the front and far behind
Bit by bit you will let yourselves

Learn new language, stick to the code.
This will be forever it's an open road.
You're in control for the very first time.
Bit by bit you will totally

unwind

rewind, rewind, rewind (x2)

---

Are you proud of your new name?
Do you love the rules of the game?
Do you feel happy or sad inside?

Do you miss the things that you did?
What about the things that you were?
Are you having the time of your life today?
