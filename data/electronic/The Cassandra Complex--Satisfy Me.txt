Give me hate, give me pain
Give me all that's in my brain
Give me life, give me death
Make me come with every breath
I need the love that makes me full
I need the love that makes me cruel
When all is said and done
I need the love that makes me come

Satisfy me

Touch me
Hold me
Feel me
Lift me up and let me fly
Touch me
Hold me
Need me
Watch me die

Satisfy me

[Rpt. 1st verse]

Satisfy me

Crucify me
Deify me
Gratify me
Liquefy me
Magnify me
Modify me
Mortify me
Purify me
Sanctify me
Simplify me
Unify me
