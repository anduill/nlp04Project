Ah-ah - feel so good! 
Ah-ah - feel so good! 
Ah-ah - feel so good! 

I woke up today by the sun and a singing bird 
And my ears were glazed 
With these simple refreshing words 
You know it feels so good to be real, yeah yeah, 
You know it feels so good just feel, yeah yeah 

La la - yeah 
La la - la 
La la - yeah 

Ah - feel so good! 
Feel so good! 
Ah - feel so good! 

Well I heard the word 
Something's going down 
And I feel like a bird in the sky, 
In the sky you know I feel so good 
Just feel this real
