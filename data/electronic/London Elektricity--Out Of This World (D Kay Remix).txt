Okay,

Walking for miles in my town I am searching for smiles on the faces I know
I feel something has changed
Get on the tube all wrapped up in the news
And the papers and gloom from day to day to day
Just throw the papers away
Cause it's all for one and one love for all

Hopefully no-one is scared or afraid
Of the faces I make spreading love all around
I think they understand
Totally safe and secure and I'm sure
All the innocent children will rise up and fight
For the better land
Cause it's all for one and one love for all
And we sing

Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa (yes we sing)
Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa
We're all out of this world (yeah yeah)
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa (oh no)

Everyone walking in time and they're talking in rhyme
Like they're playing a part
In a magical musical movie
The man from the corner shop grins as he empies the bins
Leaning forward to tell you the news
Of your lifetime
And it's all for one and one love for all
And we sing

Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa (oh yes we sing)
Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa (yeah yeah no no)
We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa

You can jump up and follow me
Like a piper of love for humanity
And I'll show the things that you've never seen
We are all in and out of this world
You can hold back, stay where you are
Let the world go by, view from afar
And you'll miss all the places you've never been
We are all in and out of this world
And we sing

Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa (oh we sing yeah yeah)
Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa (oooohhhhh yeah yeah)
Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa
Oh oh oh aaa eee aaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa

We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa
We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa

We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa
We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa

We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa
We're all out of this world
We're all out of this world
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaaa
