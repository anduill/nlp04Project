And I hate my family
And I beg to be free
Of the crap that christmas brings
An excuse for selling things
What a joy to be alone
Away from the buying zone
But this party'll never die
'Cause Christ you're such a lie

Hey, christian God get outta my face
Your holy ghost is a curse on the human race
I'd like to string you up one more time
No stupid sacrament, no pissy wine
