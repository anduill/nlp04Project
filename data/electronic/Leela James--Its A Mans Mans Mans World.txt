This is a man's world, this is a man's world
Wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
And man made them trains to carry the heavy load
It's a man's world, man's world
Wouldn't be nothin' without a woman or a girl

Man made the electric light to take us out of the dark
And man made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark
It's a man's world, it's a man's world
Wouldn't be nothin', nothin' without

Man thinks about a little baby girl and a baby boy
And man makes them happy 'cause man made them toys
And it's a man's world, a man's world
Wouldn't be nothin' without a woman or a girl

Every man needs a woman, every woman need a man
Wouldn't be nothin', nothin', nothin'

Man's world, a man's world, a man's world
It is a man's world, it is a man's world
Nothin', nothin', a man's small world
You need a woman

Let me tell what a woman can do for you
She can have your baby, she can cook your food
