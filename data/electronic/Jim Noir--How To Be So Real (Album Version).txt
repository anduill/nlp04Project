When you're making magic
Go always in the flow
Get it right and you will feel
How to be so real

If you have enough to spend
You won't have to lend
Purchase things that make it feel
How to be so real

You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow

When you're making magic
Go always in the flow
Get it right and you will feel
How to be so real

If you have enough to spend
You won't have to lend
Purchase things that make it feel
How to be so real

You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow
You will never pay your vow
