Did you see me coming?
Was I that obvious?
For all of a sudden
There were just the two of us

You don't have to be in Who's Who
To know what's what
You don't have to be a high flier
To catch your flight

The night we met
Was cold and wet
I needed a drink or two
I saw you standing there
And I knew
I'd love to be loved by you

Did you see me coming?
Was I that obvious?
For all of a sudden
There were just the two of us

You don't have to be what's what
To know who's who
You don't need the DNA
To find the proof
Then and there my life made sense
You were the evidence

Did you see me coming?
Was I that obvious?
For all of a sudden
There were just the two of us
Did you see me coming?
I thought I'd have to make
All of the running
I was all yours to take

I'm not superstitious
Or really religious
Just to thyself be true
But now I think I'm starting to believe in fate
Because it delivered you

Did you see me coming? (did you see me?)
Was I that obvious? (was I that obvious?)
For all of a sudden (for all of a sudden)
There were just the two of us (two of us)
Did you see me coming? (did you see me?)
I thought I'd have to make (thought I'd have to make)
All of the running (all of the running)
I was all yours to take (to take)
