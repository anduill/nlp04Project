I no longer understand what I see 
My skin burns from wanting 
I never knew people could do those things 
In the name of desire? 
In the name of lust? 
You've seen the act so many times 
But somehow it's always changing 
New faces 
New games 
New pleasures 
It all seems so unreal 
When you know it's only skin 
As far as the eye can see 
Forbidden excitement everlasting 
In the peepshow
