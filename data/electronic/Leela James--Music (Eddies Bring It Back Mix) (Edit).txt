Somebody play on the guitar strings
Makes me think of my favorite songs
Reminds me of when I heard Aretha sang
Gladys, Tina, and Chaka Khan
Can't go back to yesterday
Can we just put the thongs away

(Bridge)
And fall back in love with music
Nothin' but the music
Oh

Everybody knows that Marvin's gone
Still I gotta tell you what's going on
Said the music's gone

(Chorus)
Where'd the soul go?
It's all about the video
We don't sang no mo'
Where's the music gone?

Where'd the music go?
It's all just for the dough
It ain't songs no mo'
Where's the music gone?

(Verse 2)
Still hear Donny playin' them keys
Sangin' one day we'll all be free
Can't even turn on my radio
Somebody hollerin' bout a bitch or a hoe

(Bridge)
Right now I'm missing music
Back porch, down-home music
