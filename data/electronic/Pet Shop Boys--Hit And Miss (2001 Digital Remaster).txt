If you want to know why I miss you so just think back tot he first time we were in love.The night was getting lateI recognised my fateWhen you spoke, I awoke we were in love.Waiting, I'd been waiting so long for this.Waiting, all my life had been hit and miss.I knew in my heart this was only the start of a new life.Your solemn face, your eyes lit up at this surprise.My heart sped, raced ahead for we were in love.After that we stayed together every day I relaxed with the fact that we were in love, so in love.Waiting, all my life had been hit and miss.Waiting to experience such a kiss.I knew in my heart this was only the start of a new life.Now if your heart is cold and I seem to old just think back to the first time we were in love.So in love. We were in love. So in love.
