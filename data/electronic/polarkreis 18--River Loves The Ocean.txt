Water raises and wandered, called the sea
Flowers, in silent melody

I suffer from a river on a shore
I suffer when the river loves the ocean
Loves the ocean, loves the sea
Loves the ocean, a poetry

Thousand ways to find
Thousands left behind

I suffer when the river loves the ocean
Loves the ocean, loves the sea
Loves the ocean, a poetry

Thousand ways to find
Thousands left behind
All just in my mind
