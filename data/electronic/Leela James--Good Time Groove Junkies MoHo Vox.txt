Tonight is the night
we're gonna have a good time (2x)

Tonight i wanna party
can't wait to hook up with my crew
I'm so happy it's the weekend
cuz i'm gonna let my head our
and shake my thang around

Deejay hear my groove cuz i'm really in the mood and you know just what to do
tonight is my night

tonight is the night we're gonna have a good time 
let's just have a good time(2x)

forget your worries just leave em behind
cuz life's too short
you need to find a good time
so (?) your booty on the dancefloor
what you came hear foor, no parking on the floor( no no)

Deejay hear my groove cuz i'm really in the mood and you know just what to do
tonight is my night

tonight is the night we're gonna have a good time 
let's just have a good time
