Hell, spookin' all over me
But the sight of you just
Breaks my heart in 
Three - Ways of tellin' you
First you scratch the surface 
Then you pull the plug!

Chorus: 
If you get low it takes you by the hand
Daisy Duke
Don't you know
Soon it will start again
Daisy Duke

Like a dreamy resonance
The same chase oasis
Quick in a slow way
Can't you see
That I know: You won't come around
To take me away from here
