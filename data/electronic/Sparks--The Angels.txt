I heard the angels call your name
I heard the angels call your name

They feel ashamed
They feel ashamed

Because you look so fucking good
I saw the angels glaring down
I saw the angels glaring down
They feel inane
They feel in pain
Because you're oh so fucking cool

Me, I take it in stride
Me, I know I'm on the right side this time
I see the angels disappear
I see the angels disappear

They feel confused
They feel bemused
They are a pale picture of you

Me, I take it in stride
Me, I know I'm on the right side this time

They've felt the heat
And felt defeat
Because you look so fucking good

They've felt the heat
And felt defeat
Because you look so fucking good
