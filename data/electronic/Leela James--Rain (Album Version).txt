I can't take this rain, no..
when i'm bringing you joy
Won't you show me some love
Like you did before

I won't cry
I'm feeling kinda tired
I can't keep giv'em way
when you don't even try
heavy (...)
I'm trynna share a little sunshine
but your clouds are still there
why you giving me all this rain?

And i'm bringin you joy
you should show me some love
like you did before

it could be so simple babe
it's like you're pushing me away
(...)
never having anything good to say
There's gotta be a better way 
to get back that days
there's a bridge in the middle
you need to meet me half way
instead of playing all these games

When i'm bringing you joy
won't you show me some love
like you did before

And i think i won't (2x)
won't cry
i'm feeling kinda tired
i can't keep give'em way
when you don't even try
Heavy (...)
I tried to share a little sunshine
but your clouds are still there
why you giving me rain?
When i keep bringin you joy
won't you show me some love
like you did before
i can't take this rain
please show me some love
(rain)
oh i can't take this rain
I need a . a little love
we used to be so good together
i can't take the rain no more
