You must not love to hate
You must not take the bait
And learn to hit delete
You'd say the same thing to me
Rent's high
And the war's on
And it's last call
Even your friends look worried
My friends think you're smart
We think you're super-fine

But it's high time
I mean it's high tide
Aka a fine line, inside

Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face 'cause:
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess!

You must not roll your eyes
You should not often lie
How could you ever say
That your friends won't be there
It's a long walk on a cold night
When you wanna fight
Over some day-old drama
You used to make us laugh
We want the old you back

'cause it's high time
I mean it's high tide
Aka a fine line, inside

Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face 'cause
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess!

This island where we live without a/c
Is the city where we learn about painting
It was the title of the mix-tape you gave me
Not where we're from but the topic of daydreams
Let's take a tour of the bathrooms you cried in
For break-ups, bad lucks, shock of the lost twins

The horizon's like a ship in flames tonight
You say you just don't know
If you can take this city
Cos the rent's high
And the war's on
And it's last call
Even your friends look worried
My friends all think you're smart
We think you're super-fine

But it's high time
I mean it's high tide
Aka a fine line, inside

Stop smoking those cigarettes, baby
Next time it's your turn to save me
Splash some water on your little face 'cause
You're a mess, you're a mess, you're a mess!
