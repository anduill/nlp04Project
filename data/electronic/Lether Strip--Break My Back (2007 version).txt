Perverted dreams are inside my head
Slandered surround the dead
Sculled bones incubate the souls
That died with hate
The narrow net by the black and gold
The weather change your body feels cold
Your eyes are burning
Haze in your head
You feel the pain let's go, let's go dead

Just break my back
You have to break my back

Pain, pain, pain, pain is pleasure

Body sweats surround your skin
Just don't think of the stage you're in
Pain is pure
Ecstasy
Pain is made to make you see
