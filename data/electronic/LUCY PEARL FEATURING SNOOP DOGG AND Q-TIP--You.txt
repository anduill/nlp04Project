I put it down for the LBC
(I put it down for a place called Queens)
You know I represent the 213
(I hold it down for the big city)
I keep it gangsta for all my young g's
(All the P-Y-T's with they own car keys)
I put it down for all the ladies
its all about you

[Raphael Saadiq]
I tried to look the other way
But there you passed me by
I saw you holding Q Tips hand
And girl danm near died
They way you hold that cosmo
Just fits you to a tee
But I just wish that you was sitting
Right next to me
I wonder what was God's mind
The day that he made you
I know he wrote a new commandment
After he was through
But every time i see you 
I find something new
I just gotta have you

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

I really want you
I just gotta have you

[Raphael Saadiq]
Me and nephew snoop was eating
At the serving spoon
And my partner skin it back
Was sitting with us too
And all of a sudden
Your body was inside
I couldn't finish breakfast
Now something just aint right
Now snoop was looking like
What the hell is wrong with you
I said I know you understand
Youve been through a few
But this one is special
Special to me
Is it my imagination killing me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

I really want you
I just gotta have you

[Snoop Dogg]
I just can't fake it no more
I can't take it no more
I need you in my life for sure
My wife for sure
No turning back
It's on and crackin'
Pure satisfaction 
Girl that's what's haps
