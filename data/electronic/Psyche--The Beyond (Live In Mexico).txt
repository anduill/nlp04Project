There are promises meant to be kept 
But I never expected this at all 
The security we dream about 
Makes us desperate and confused 
And the feeling returns 
Even when the night is falling 
Somewhere beyond the lights 
What shall become of us? 
BEYOND THE LIGHTS! 
IT'S IN OUR MINDS! 
Illusions can sometimes be swallowed 
Protection stays within our hearts 
Pay the price for wanting more 
Believing in this cruel uncertainty 
And the feeling returns 
Even when the night is falling 
Somewhere beyond the lights 
What shall become of us
