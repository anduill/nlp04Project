The chase is on for happiness,
a pleasure so immense no words could tell you,
and in this love, I'll be your temple,
with me alone, you'll be complete
your emptiness wont ease the pain,
you no longer my story, someone should tell you,
I'm, balancing the curbs, so unafraid,
yeah, i might fall into the road,
and hit my head,? a season spent?
ooh, I'm, measuring your words, dont hesitate,
how cleverly you ramble
but its too late, the debt is paid,
desire's gone, the light has died,
those golden moments, the colours fading,
the storm has left the tranquil earth,
my breathing slowing,
it's obsolete,
there's magic in each melting hour,
no, I can't resist, someone should tell you


I'm, balancing the curbs, so unafraid,
yeah, i might fall into the road,
and hit my head,? a season spent?
ooh, I'm, measuring your words, don't hesitate,
how cleverly you ramble
but its too late, the debt is paid,
so unafraid, so unafraid
and in my hand is a faith
(so unafraid)
I'm, balancing the curbs, so unafraid,
yeah, I might fall into the road,
and hit my head,? a season spent?
ooh, I'm, measuring your words, dont hesitate,
how cleverly you ramble
but it's too late, so unafraid
so unafraid
yeah, I might fall into the road,
and hit my head,? a season spent?
I'm, measuring your words, dont hesitate,
how cleverly you ramble
but its too late
I'm unafraid
