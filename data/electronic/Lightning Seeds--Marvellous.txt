Oh, you had to fit but you're fit to drop
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvelous, things could be fabulous

You need a push, I'll push you off
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvelous soon

Oh well, these are the days and this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find, won't you ever make your mind up?

Oh, you had to hit 'til you hit the top
Open up the window and jump into the blue
Things could be marvelous, things could be fabulous soon

Oh, well these are the days and this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find, won't you ever make your mind up?

Now you'll never be sure, if this is the time, if this is the moment
The end of the line, you'll never decide
You used to know but now you've forgotten

You sit there and wait for the phone to ring, when are they going to call
Are they ever going to call you at all but then, oh
Things could be marvelous, things could be fabulous soon

Oh, well these are the days and this is the life
There'll always be something on your mind
You'll never quite find, won't you ever make your mind up?

Now you'll never be sure if this is the time, if this is the moment
The end of the line, you'll never decide
You used to know but now you've forgotten

A submarine got stuck to the bottom
These are the days so wake up
'Cause this is the time and you know I'm right
