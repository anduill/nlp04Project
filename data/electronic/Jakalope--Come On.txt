Do you want a piece of my time
Or a piece of my mind?
A bit of this chip on my shoulder
My blanket's on you, don't get cold
Do you wanna cover your eyes?
Do you wanna see through mine?
Taking my darkest years so you don't disappear

I'll give you
All of me
Then I can walk away
Free from the weight of the world with relief
So come on
Come on

Do you really want my arms
So you can hold my hand
Take the skin off of my back
Take the feet from under me so you can stand
Taking all the people I like
Breaking all my sunny skies
And I will take all of your rain, for the ones you hate

I'll give you
All of me
Then I can walk away
Free from the weight of the world with relief
So come on
Come on

I'll give you
All of me
Then I can walk away
Free from the weight of the world with relief
But you can't even see that I'm failing to breathe
So come on
Come, come
Come on

Walk away
Walk away
Walk away
