The beauty of her, under electric light
The beauty of her, under electric light
Tears my heart out every time

Dawn There waiting, right outside 
Dawn There waiting, right outside 
She tears my heart out every time

Siren rising across the sky
Sirens rising across the sky
Tears my heart out every time
