Once, now and then and never again
Once, now and then and never again
All night we turn and turn
It makes sense to turn again
All night we turn and turn
Innocence, too young to love
Alone

Once, now and then and never again [x4]
Break

Once, now and then and never again
Once, now and then and never again

All night we turn and turn
It makes sense to turn again
All night we turn and turn
Innocence, too young to love
Alone

Alone alone alone
And you're too young to love
And you're too young to love

Once, now and then and never again
Once, now and then and never again

All night we turn and turn
It makes sense to turn again
All night we turn and turn
In a sense too young to love
Alone
