I saw you, watching 
Your face in the dark 
In the shadows, call for a name 
Sometimes the deceit, some kind of lies 
Did it mean anything? 
See you in my dreams 
It was a twist in the night 
You were alive to me 
It was a hopefull sight 
It wasn't said to be 
And now I settle down 
In a conscious state 
And I know I can't 
Because it's too late 
Can I take it back? 
Like a piece of fate 
Look into my eyes, and don't you lie to me 
It was only for a moment 
It was only for a breath of time 
Did it mean anything? 
The touch of your flesh on mine 
Now, I don't care where you are 
No, I don't care where you are 
But I know in my heart I'll try to find you 
Now, I don't care where you are 
It's just a kiss in the night 
And now it's been a long time 
Can I take it back? 
Your flesh on mine 
These are the ties that bind 
These are the tears in my eyes 
It was only a moment in time 
It was only a look in your eyes 
The measure of your kiss 
A second of perfect bliss 
These are the ties that bind 
These are the tears in my eyes 
Will you give it back to me? 
Will you give me back my life? 
I need that moment back 
These are the tears in my eyes
