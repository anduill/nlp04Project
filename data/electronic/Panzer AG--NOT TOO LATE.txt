The patience of eternity
The greatest gift I could ever get
You give me life
And you take from your own
I could only wish
To be more like you
If you put your hand on my chest
You'll feel your soul
It's in my heartbeat and it drives me on
I know I'm not what you imagined me to be
I'm barely a fraction carved out of your heart

I'll make you proud
I'll stand my ground
I know I disappointed you
I'll make it right
I'll outlast the fight
I swear I will honour you

If you put your hand on my chest
You will feel your soul
It's in my heartbeat
And it drives me on
You give me life
And you take from your own
The patience of eternity
The greatest gift I could ever get

I'll make you proud
I'll stand my ground
I know I disappointed you
I'll make it right
I'll outlast the fight
I swear I will honour you

But you cry for me
But you lied to protect me
I never learned and now I need to face myself
I'll make you proud
I'll stand my ground
I know I disappointed you

I'll make it right
I'll outlast the fight
I swear I will honour you
I'll make you proud
I'll stand my ground
I know I disappointed you
