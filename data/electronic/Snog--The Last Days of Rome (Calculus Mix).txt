here comes the good juice
gotta cut the hate loose
gotta tell you how i feel
i know you like it real
one day the sun will grow
and swallow up your home
consume all you own
with pleasure i will groan
if i cut then i bleed
all day long
just to please you
the last days of rome
the palaces
the towers
will rot inside of hours
bereft of their powers
the seeds they have sown
the suburbs
and the city
the foul air makes me giddy
so seldom is it witty
the last days of rome
if i cut then i bleed
all day long
just to please you
the last days of rome
and i chewed the chewing gum of hate
i chewed it long, i chewed it late
and i chewed that chewing gum of hate
munch munch, grate grate
one day the sun will grow
and swallow up your home
consume all you own
with pleasure i will groan
the palaces
the towers
will rot inside of hours
bereft of their powers
the seeds they have sown
the suburbs
and the city
the foul air makes me giddy
so seldom is it witty
the last days of rome
if i cut then i bleed
all day long
just to please you
the last days of rome
