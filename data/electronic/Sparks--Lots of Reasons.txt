Lots Of Reasons
Lots of reasons why I'm chasing you
Lots of reasons only you will do
The way you look is like a movie star
Lots of reasons why I've gone this far
Everyday you'll find me on your trail

Lots of problems but I will not fail
You're intelligent but that's no threat
I've been reading every chance I get

CHORUS
And I'm closer to you each day
But you manage to slip away
But I'll never give up on you
I could be fifty
I could be sixty
I could be seventy
I could be eighty

Lots of reasons why I will not fail
You're a walkin' talkin' Holy Grail
I got stamina and I got shoes
And I gotta nothing else to do

CHORUS

Lots of times I thought of giving up
Lots of times I said, "Enough's enough."
Then I thought of what you mean to me
How you made a real fiend of me

CHORUS

Lots of reasons why I'm chasing you
Lots of reasons only you will do
I can feel a real affinity
Stirring up my masculinity

Lots of reasons
Lots of reasons
Lots of reasons
Lots of reasons, yeah
