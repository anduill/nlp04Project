I am the voyeur laying next to you at night
Watching you in your sleep
I am your source of strength
When it all falls down and you're on your knees
And when the day comes and everybody's gone
You can call me a friend
I'll be here for your new beginnings
And I'll be here in the end, here in the end
I'm going to tell the world I love you, baby girl
Yell it out in the streets
Going to talk about the joy you bring me, girl
What you're doing to me
I am the shining star you see at night
When you're in the storm
I am the beating heart that's by your side
When you're in my arms
And when the day comes, when everybody's long gone
I'm watching you sleep
You don't have to worry if you've got my heart
It's yours to keep
I'm going to tell the world I love you, baby girl
Yell it out in the streets
Going to talk about the joy you bring me, girl
What you're doing to me
I'm going to tell the world I love you, baby girl
Yell it out in the streets
Going to talk about the joy you bring me, girl
What you're doing to me
There is love for all God's children
We all breathe in the same sun
We all sleep under the stars at night
We know that we are one
There is love for all God's children
We all breathe in the same sun
We all sleep under the stars at night
We know that we are one
And you're the one for me
I'm going to tell the world I love you, baby girl
Yell it out in the streets
Going to talk about the joy you bring me, girl
What you're doing to me
I'm going to tell the world I love you, baby girl
Yell it out in the streets
Going to talk about the joy you bring me, girl
What you're doing to me
I am the voyeur laying next to you at night
Watching you in your sleep
I am your source of strength when it all falls down
And you're on your knees
