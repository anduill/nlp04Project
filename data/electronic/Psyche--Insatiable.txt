I close my eyes to try and forget
All the things that you said
I should've known it wasn't right
Too force the blame on you

Memories will fade away
Along with the passing time
But I can't seem to let you go
From my dreams at night

Tears that burned in my eyes
Leaving me the wretched soul
I've got to fill this emptiness
I am insatiable
Insatiable
