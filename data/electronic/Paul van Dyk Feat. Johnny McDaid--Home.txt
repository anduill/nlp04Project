The people poured their concrete floors, 
And built their churches and their walls, 
They painted pictures of their hopes and fears on them. 

A single look, a tiny touch can change the system, it's enough, 
And I can see it all in you love. 

And your eyes explode with light, explode with light, I'm covered in your light. 

My home is where you are, 
In every beat, in every beat we're closer. 
My home is where you are, 
In every beat, in every beat we're closer.
