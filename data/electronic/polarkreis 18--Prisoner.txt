For me this time (for me this time)
Or once our soul (or once our soul)
Behind my eyelid, there looks somebody

strange of the my (strange of the my)
down for my mind (cause all when we fly)
you see my face, it looks not like me

the language is you, calling to side
And name the name of my in the night
behind your eyelids there look somebody

You say it loudly, say it quiet
say it twice, there's no way out 
behind your eyelids, there looks somebody

for melt in self, for melt in self
I melt itself,I melt itself
for melt itself, for melt itself
or melt itself, for melt itself

For me this time, we are both ourself
a mirror there can't turn away
the mirror smiles, it smiles at me
a wondered smile, I can't reply

I clinch my fist, I try to hit
the mirror breaks into pieces
a broken piece, I hold it tight
behind my eyelids, there looks somebody
