It was a cold and a rainy night
When all stars began to shine
And in this brightest light
He appeared to our planet

He was young and strong enough
To save us all from the shadows
That followed us from the darkest world
With no love but only sorrow

And we are not alone in darkness
We are not alone
Our hearts are full of passion
Passion for a better world
And the love that was discovered
Was the thing that we had lost
And our hearts are beating faster
We are the ones who are not alone

He was a savior from the sky
Full of hope for a better life
He tried to spread his wings of love
Like a shield against the shadows

When the darkest night was gone
And our hearts were warm again
In the skies appeared a star sign
With the shape of two wings
