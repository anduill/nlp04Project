stand
under
fountain
cool skin
wash clean
wash him
from me
along comes wind
a big bone-shaker
blows off my clothes
completely naked
what to do
when everything
has left you?

out of the blue
it is he
a vision to me
bearing leaves
petals green
covers me
in all my shame
hand in hand
he's my big man
stays with me
some forty days
no words 
then goes away
i cry again
