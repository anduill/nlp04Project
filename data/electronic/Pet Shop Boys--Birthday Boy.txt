Birthday boy
Can't explain
Christmas Eve
He's born again
On the line a broken train going nowhere endless rain
Birthday boy so afraid plays the machines in the arcade

Oh baby do you remember he's been through all this before? Spent the summer getting nowhere
Taking all of the blame for the city calculating from pain comes pity
Christmas Eve a time of joy if you believe in Birthday boy
This time around it's all a mistake Is he deluded or just a fake?
Oh baby do you remember he's been through all this before? Spent the summer getting nowhere
Taking all of the blame for the city calculating
from pain comes pity
If you knew his name would you feel the same? If you knew his name?
Birthday boy stands apart as the drama's about to start

A quick betrayal
A speedy trial
As before
Complete denial
Oh baby do you remember he's been through all this before? Spent the summer getting nowhere

Taking all of the blame for the city calculating
From pain comes pity
If you knew his name would you feel the same?
