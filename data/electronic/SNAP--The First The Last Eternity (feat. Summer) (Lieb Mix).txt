Eternity eternity, eternity... 

People all over the world 
Listen to what I wanna say 
Now I need all of your attention 
Come along with me 
You don't have to worry 
Good news is on the way 
I'm talking about the way things started out
Gonna end that same

Eternity eternity, eternity... 

Let's getting ready 
For the final destiny 
Gather all about your people 
And come with me 
I'm gonna be your guardian angle
Oh,oh,on high
Come on come on it's time 

The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 

The first the last eternity 
As it's written it will always be 
Till the end of time 
Do you here me

The first the last eternity 
As it's written it will always be 
Till the end of time 
Do you here me

The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 

ohh....

Eternity eternity, eternity... 

The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity 
The first the last eternity
