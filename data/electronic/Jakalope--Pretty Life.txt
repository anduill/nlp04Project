I am just over your shoulder
Baby, babe
You make me feel colder by turning away
Would you stop for a second
I'm asking you a question
About...
You know why I am
[You know, you know, you know why]

I'm about to change your pretty mind
I'm about to change your pretty life

You can close your eyes
But do you taste my breath?
Hear my voice drowning
You feel my skin on your back
Hey, I see you falling
And on your knees
You're crawling
Back, back to me
[You know, you know, you know why]

I'm about to change your pretty mind
I'm about to change your pretty life
Are you ready?
There's no stopping time

'Cos, 'cos, 'cos, 'cos
You could be the reason I love
You could be the reason I love
You could be the reason I cry
You could, you could, you could, you could

I'm about to change your pretty mind
I'm about to change your pretty life
I can see the fear that's in your eyes
Are you ready?
There's no stopping time

You could be the reason I love
You could be the reason I love
You could be the reason I cry
You could, you could
You could be the reason why
