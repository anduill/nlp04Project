Always thought she'd stick around
always thought she'd stay
Now he's searching for the ring
the one she had to throw away
beach comber casts a shadow
long as his beard
never thought to cut it since his lover disappeared 
she left him in this crazy state he's in 
scouring the shoreline oh looking for the ring

oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger
she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer

there's a rhythm to his madness
a rhythm that he's in
retracing all the steps he walked
where once he was a king
his heart jolts awake to the beeps of
his machine starts racing faster faster
till it's a steady stream
he riffles through every grain of sand
one for everything that slipped through his hands
and his friends have all gone
gone with the tide
and he's standing on the shoreline
stranded in time

oh the ring that was wrapped around her finger
she was just a dream and he was just a dreamer

beach combing for his lost gold
something to have and to hold
oh small fortunes they sat and stay
too long to wash away
sweat dripping from his head
like a bridal shower
and dampening the gleaming sand
but mixed with tears so sour

'cause he is just a dreamer 
she was just a dream
he is just a dreamer
she was just a dream

he is just a dreamer she is just a dream 
she is just a dream he is just a dreamer

she was just a dream 

he is just a dreamer
