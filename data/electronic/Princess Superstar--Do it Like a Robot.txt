I made a wish on Aladdin an imaginary menagerie in Manhattan
filled with robots dancin like Michael Jacksons or Janet Jacksons- Control
Ms. Princess that's me, Ms. Princess Fuck you if you nasty
Need 411 son just ask me, I'm everywhere you wanna be
Ring the Bell like Atlantic hard wired round the world I make the crowd get frantic
Let me be candid, I'm pedantic, you might not understand it
I attack but play like Mamet bzz dammit watch your back my brains are damaged
Bionic lady call me Jaime me and Million buck man we gonna save Slim Shady
I'm Crazy my genetic code programmed for robot mode computer human antidote
MP3 LCD's in my BVD's G3 key snot I sneeze
You forgot-Please I remember every number
Buy 1 thousand condoms at Price Club I'm a member

[Hook]
Go baby go baby what! Go baby go baby what! Just do it like a robot

[Verse Two]
Transmission nifty, shift your stick in position in a jiffy
Pop! You missed me, Popcorn maker in my pussy
Like Debussy I kick minuets kicked cigarettes
now I make bigger bets than figureheads
Get down on bigger beds than chickenheads
what I said, Head my letterhead, AC/DC I'm a metalhead
No "Strobelight Ho" but sick in silhouettes
Trained like a track get back exact M.I.T. Lab I'm back
Damn this baby's stacked you want cash I'm NASDAQ
You like that give the pin I'm MAC, I crashed
Mathematical, unflappable never take grammatical sabbaticals
Advance on mechanicals unstoppable I'm topical
Invent new robot shit like butt mixed with popsicle -What?
It's the Babygotbackical
Are you on crack at all? Nah I'm clean squeaky on Ajax
Scratch that I'm on magnets
Doo doo doo do inspect my gadgets

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse Three]
In my stomach, I got a blender, drink lemonade
bend for Bender whims like Wender
You remember the soda vendor you kicked? Get you in December
Data and matter I'm madder than a hatter I gather
Spin letters much faster than Vanna, bananas
Cut tongues like Mick Jagger when I dabble in anger
C'mon gives me kicks I'm a steel chick
Plastic metal unreal chick/I dig
Numbers and engines sprockets and chrome Benzes
Rhodedendrums shear em with x-ray lenses
Senses/don't have em don't want em-fool
Senseless/ don't argue I am programmed to beat you
Teach you a thing or two
About the 20th Century and the 21-
January 1 be the same shit as December 31
And I'm not the one to put the damper
Go party, drink 40's pee your pants with the Pamper
Clothes in the hamper, dried sticky throw-up mouth sore with the canker
By the power of Grayskull I'm the Master of the Universe
I am money, take this bitch to the banker
I am money, take this bitch to the banker
