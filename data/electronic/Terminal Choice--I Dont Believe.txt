I don't believe there's someone in the sky
I don't believe that someone cares when i die
I don't believe my soul will live forever...

I don't believe in god
I don't believe in heaven

I don't believe there's someone in the sky
I don't believe that someone cares when i die
I don't believe my soul will live forever...

I don't believe in god
I don't believe in the devil
I just believe in myself
