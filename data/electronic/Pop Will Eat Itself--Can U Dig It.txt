We like the music, we like the disco sound...hey!
We like the music, we like the disco sound...hey!
We like the music, we like the disco sound...hey!
We like the music, we like the disco sound...hey!

We dig TV we dig remote control,
We dig the Furry Freak Brothers and the Twilight Zone,
We dig Marvel and D.C., we dig Run-DMC,
We dig Renegade Soundwave and AC/DC
(Can U dig it?)

CHORUS
Bruce Wayne auf wiedersehn,
Dirty Harry, "Make my day,"
Terminator, hit the north,
Alan Moore knows the score,
Riffs? Yeah! Can U dig it?
Riffs? Yeah! Can U dig it?

We dig Optimus Prime and not Galvetron,
We dig "The Leader of the Pack" and the "Do-Run-Run",
Spinderella and Bruce Lee, "The Bad and the Ugly",
"V for Vendetta" and "Into the Groovy".
(Can U dig it?)

CHORUS

We like the music, we like the disco song...hey!
We like the music, we like the disco song...hey!
