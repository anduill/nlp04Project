a juggler
breathes this hour
knows the wire of indecision
with each passing conversation
when the juggler
moved in neon
in the aftermath
weighted all the lines
tired to take them back
in the aftermath
through the juggler
see a pattern
reason passing
from eye to hand
with each passing conversation
note the wire of indecision
in the aftermath
weighted all the lives
tried to take them back
in the aftermath
option roles and minds
the catalyst reacts
in the aftermath
the juggler
breathes each hour
toes the wire of indecision
