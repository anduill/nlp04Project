If you're fallin' in love, let me show ya
At least a thousand reasons why
You should take your time,
Before you fall again.

If you're still in love, now's a good time
To wish upon the stormy sky
And take your time.
Trust and you will win.

So you got that lookin'
Like you lost your best friend.
Said he didn't get to know you,
Didn't 'ven get to see you,
For all the beauty in you.
You chose to set aside,
You chose to compromise,
Every time you saw the danger [?] come flashing in

Oh, we're so proud of ourselves,
We are only human,
There is lessons we all could learn

If you're fallin' in love, let me show ya
At least a thousand reasons why
You should take your time,
Before you fall again.

If you're still in love, now's a good time
To wish upon the stormy sky
And take your time.
Trust and you will win.

Oh, it's so hard to be alone,
It feels so good to have a kindred soul.
But it's better when it's on equal ground,
That's the kind of love that stays around.
