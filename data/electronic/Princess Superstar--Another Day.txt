Sittin here chillin with my Cream o Wheat
I got Dearfoam slippers adornin my tiny feet
Freezin cold chillin 'cause they turned off my heat
You know I'm screamin at the landlord, Pete
You know I just got fired from the Chinese Restaurant
Told you I was working hard fto buy stuff that I ain't got
So I found another job you know it's all the same
Now I'm dressin like a chump playin the 9-5 lame
Now it's 9:03 am and I'm behind the desk
So damn bored so I'm thinkin bout sex
And tryin to remember I'm a superstar
Knowin' my success won't be that far away
Another Day
Another Day
Pantyhose itchin up my legs and shit
Stretchin on the swivel chair, yeah that's where I sit
And the grub from the telephone is makin' me a new zit
Boss is yellin for some coffee here's my gat and clip
Another Day
Another Day
