So confusin', so irrational
Must be fiction or a natural
D'you believe me when you hear me say
All my trouble seems to fade away?

When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes
When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes
Drownin' within your eyes

Stay with me, stay forever now
Wanna show you all the love I have
True affection like a spell on me
And I know you'll set it free

When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes
When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes

D'you believe me when you hear me say
All my trouble seems to fade away?

When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes
When you're near I'm walkin' on sunshine
When you're near I'm drownin' within your eyes
