Pull the curtain over the head
Blackened by all the needs
Feel the grift that sent them to God
Belief in another, the carbine is lifted
Heard the voice, the high screaming
Situation welded sensation
The murderer's among us and we are the lifted
The masters have all been anointed

Melted wing and prayer
As angels would say
Built to erase
Your coldest trace
You're like a movie now
Melted wing and prayer

Pulled the curtain over the head
Heard the voice that pitched screaming
Filling the jars with all the hatred
The masters among us and we are anointed

Melted wing and prayer
As angels would say
Built to erase
Your coldest trace
You're like a movie now
Melted wing and prayer

Pull the curtain over the head
Blackened my life with all such needs
Feel the grift that sent them to God
Belief in another the carbine is lifted

Melted wing and prayer
As angels would say
Built to erase
Your coldest trace
You're like a movie now
Melted wing and prayer
