You think you'll come over
I'll give you my number
You lover supporter
Then give me your mother
You come take me home and
Take me to your doctor
You think you'll come over?

I think I'm a mother

Roll over, roll over
And roll me a man-a
You lover, my lover
You just roll me over
You give me your mother
A man if I love her
I love her, I'll keep her
I better just keep her

" Come on and support her "
I said to the mother
She said you come over
She said she'd support her
I love her, I kept her
And then she just left and
Alone, I emplore ya
I think I'm a mother
Need your mother, more than ever
Need your mother
