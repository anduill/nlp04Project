A life of work, is a life of crime
You pay your taxes, you serve your time
All that money, where does it go?
Schools, prisons, hospitals, roads
Government funding of military science
Genetically engineered ultraviolent
DNA, killer genes to program microchips, marines
See stealth bombers and tomahawks on CNN, pay-per-view war

Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise

Hey wage slave where's your profit share?
They got ya down they're gonna keep you there
Freeze your mind, metamorphose
Cocaine karma in the heroin zone
Multinational life is cheap, soldiers, workers, maggots meat
Get on up, protest riot, are you collateral damage or a legitimate target?

Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise

Sweet sixteen dehumanized, deaths head factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized, deaths head factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized, deaths head factory suicide
Sweet sixteen dehumanized, deaths head factory suicide

Rise, rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise, rise
