We wander for miles along the ocean
With a knife-shaped stone
We cut our veins

Rivers of tears
Fills my empty body with blood
A dialogue with shadows
It passes into the dark

It is polar night
All life is past
We speak in tongues

I'm not afraid
Soon reigns peace
It is polar night

I'm sleepy, I hold the moon
It passes, I'm invisible

I throw myself out, no time for rest
Like a dream, I touch your lips
