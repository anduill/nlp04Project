Frank Tovey Taught Me Things
Soft Cell they kept me sane
Martin Gore would make me sing
But Mr. Tovey was to blame

Frank Tovey Taught Me Things
I saw myself in Sommerville
Bronski Beat could make me move
But MUTE they wouldnâ€™t pay my bills

Frank Tovey Taught Me Things
While Human League made history
Jean-Michel was in my dreams
The Black Celebration changed me

Frank Tovey...

Frank Tovey Taught Me Things
Skinny splattered blood one me
Front 242 gave me a sign
I hope Frank Tovey heard me

Frank Tovey, Frank Tovey...

Frank Tovey Taught Me Things
