Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line

Speak your piece, speak your mind
Leave no points undefined
We may be undermined
Numbers assigned and then confined

They will try to realign
And get us to leave our thoughts behind
You want your message to shine?
Don't stand in line

Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line

Speak your piece, speak your mind
Leave no points undefined
We may be undermined
Numbers assigned and then confined

They will try to realign
And get us to leave our thoughts behind
You want your message to shine?
Don't stand in line

Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line

Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line
Don't stand in line
