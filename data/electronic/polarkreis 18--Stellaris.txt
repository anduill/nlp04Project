When the day is gone, 
I’m walking around with another love
The story blinds like a headlight 
A thousands words 
You are telling me: Don’t know them, I know this sound
I want you

The flower grow up like me
But shall I begin?
with the secrets of memorie
in the lights again, 

I’ve seen a picture from you
All I can do is love you
It says: Why remember? Get on upset!

The day is gone, 
I’m walking around with another love
My story blinds like a headlight
A thousands words 
Yeah, You are telling me: Don’t know them I know this sound
I want you

I still do and even try!

The flower grow up like me
But shall I begin?
with the secrets of memorie
in the lights again, 

I’ve seen a picture from you
All I can do is love you
It says: Why remember? Get on upset!
