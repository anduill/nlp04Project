you don't have to go on like this
there's so much more for you, I give you everything there's nothing you will ever miss
all the people will abuse you in this life
society will always fuck you up and politicians they'll always lie

you don't have to go on like this
you don't have to go on like this

chorus:
have you ever been on a trip like this
since the end of all your fears
free your mind and just take everything you need
I take all the pain when you want me 
show you what you have never seen
I am the synthetic seduction
I'm everything you need

you don't have to go on like this
you don't have to go on like this

do you feel like nothing goes your way
do you ever think about what could be someone tells you "that's ok"
when you look in the mirror what do you se
is this what you want to see do you really think that's the only way life could be

you don't have to go on like this
you don't have to go on like this

chorus

you don't have to go on like this
there's so much more for you, I give you everything there's nothing you will ever miss
all the people will abuse you in this life
society will always fuck you up and politicians they'll always lie
