Life don't get no better than this 
Like closing your eyes and making a wish
(1st Verse)

I'm worn out, wrecked and I haven't slept
This rat race has got me feeling stressed
So I grab me a cab to the other side of town
I think that it's time I caught the other side of down
And that's where you wait with your hands on your hips
And greet me again with my bowl and fish
(Pre Chorus)

She brings me peace
She lets me sleep
I am at ease
(Chorus)

(When I'm sick and tired of feeling this low)
This is the way we spend our days
(Like we're the last two people left here to know)
Sitting under weeping willows
(Like closing your eyes and making a wish)
Inhaling the horizon's haze
(Life don't get no better than this)
With my head a rest on Suzie's pillow
(2nd Verse)

She takes me by the hand and she throws me a wink
Thoughts that never crossed my mind I seem to think
It gets me all choked up and I don't know why
These butterflies gotta fly around and mess with me inside
She draws me into her getaway
Everything she does is A ok
(Pre Chorus)

She brings me peace
She lets me sleep
I am at ease
(Chorus)

(When I'm sick and tired of feeling this low)
This is the way we spend our days
(Like we're the last two people left here to know)
Sitting under weeping willows
(Like closing your eyes and making a wish)
Inhaling the horizon's haze
(Life don't get no better than this)
With my head a rest on Suzie's pillow
(Bridge)

Sailing away with her, my head is in the clouds
Sharing this place with her she gives me every ounce
It's just the way she turns the light inside of me
Opens my mind to what I thought I'd never, 
thought I'd never see
(Chorus)

(When I'm sick and tired of feeling this low)
This is the way we spend our days
(Like we're the last two people left here to know)
Sitting under weeping willows
(Like closing your eyes and making a wish)
Inhaling the horizon's haze
(Life don't get no better than this)
With my head a rest on Suzie's pillow
