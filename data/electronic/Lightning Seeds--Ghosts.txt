In this room
There’s no pictures on my wall
The music plays
I can’t hear it anymore

The world turns round
Sun goes down
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom

A voice outside
Shadows on the wall
A thousand eyes
They can’t see me anymore

The world turns round (world turns round)
Sun goes down (sun goes down)
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom

Don’t you know
the world can be so cruel
Sometimes it leaves you feeling like a fool
The world, it turns
And now it’s turned on you

The world turns round
Sun goes down
And all the ghosts inside my room
Are laughing in the evening gloom

The world turns round (world turns round)
Sun goes down (sun goes down)
The world turns round (world turns round)
World turns round
Sun goes down (sun goes down)
Down
The world turns round (world turns round)
World turns round
Sun goes down (sun goes down)
Down
