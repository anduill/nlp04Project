You know this boogie is for real

I used to put my faith in worship
But then my chance to get to Heaven slipped
I used to worry about the future
But then I threw my caution to the wind
I had no reason to be care free
No no no, until I took a trip to the other side of town
Yeah yeah yeah, you know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey - I had no choice but to get down down down down

Dance, nothing left for me to do but dance
All these bad times I'm going through just dance
Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby

I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's heaven sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
Because of the boogie I feel so hell bent, hey hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I never ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between hell and high water
I need a cure to make it through

Hey dance
nothing left for me to do but dance
All these bad times I'm going through just dance
Hey got canned heat in my heels tonight baby
You know know know I'm gonna dance yeah
All the nasty things that people say dance
yeah but I'm gonna make it anywaydance
yeah got canned heat up my heels tonight baby
You know I've got canned heat up my heels

You know this boogie is for real

Only the wind can blow the answer
And she cries to me when I'm asleep
She says you know that you can go much faster
I know that peoples' talk can be so cheap
I got this voodoo child inveined on me
I'm gonna use my power to ascend
You know I got these running heels to use
Sometimes there's no way I lose
I was born to rock and built to last
You've can't see my feet cause they move so fast

Dance yeah, hey nothing left for me to do but dance
All these bad times I'm going through just dance, hey
Got canned heat in my heels tonight baby

Hey I've got to dance yeah
All the nasty things that people say dance
