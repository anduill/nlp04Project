So many reasons to stay around
Just as many to go
I guess I could see my days slipping on by
But you got me, you got me up
That's why I get up

No one else would call me to get me out of bed
And no one else seems to fuck inside my head like you do
And you do
Yeah you do, you do it daily
You do it daily

You're my cup of tea
Just as how I like it to be
I just, I just, I just want to thank you
Since you got me up
Since you got me up
Since you got me up
