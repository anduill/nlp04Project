another hour burned
it seems to take away
the screen charm forwarding
just to scale the weight
one speaks in terms of blue
the other in nylon
the black framed degree of moves
drawn an option
testing the drive
start splitting lives
inviting the rain
opening the play
mind takes an old train
just to see again
just to breathe again
the clippings are spread
red littered round
al pages bent and faded
glass gilded crown
through a fluid speech
learning seems unto each
the actions complete
the rationale will bleed
pulsed and waiting
in a chair watching
an open invitation
closed to suggestion
