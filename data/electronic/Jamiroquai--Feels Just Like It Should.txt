I'm comin' out to see ya
I'm lookin' for it fast and cheap
I'm lookin' for the back of the streets

(Yeah-ow)

I'm gonna get experienced
I've been to see the candyman
Just turn it up and drown

(She said)

Feels just like it should (Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (I'm gonna get experienced)
Feels just like it should (Turn it up and drown)

I'm goin' out with laserbeams
To shoot some cherries down
I took a little free-agent
I got myself a five mile smile

So baby for the first time
I need a little sugar spice
I wanna see the city lights
I'm gonna find a number

(She said)

Feels just like it should (Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (I'm lookin' for it fast and cheap)

Feels just like it should (I've been to see the candyman. Yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should
