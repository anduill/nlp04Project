"Where you gonna go? Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide?
Nowhere. Because there's no one like you left." -Bodysnatchers 

Find
Words fade above the snow
The carved out somebody stitch
The carver's all who waves surrender
Through all tempers looking back
The skin begins to crack
Those ever double jointed blamers

Fine
Closed off no power the wheel inside no peace
No feeling all disease around security

Eyes
Devised the cycles find
A call that's never caught
Beneath the locusts timed decision

Find
The vice grips never freed
A crease upon one's debt
And never paying forward

Hate
What will we won't be late
What will be left today
When nothing left to beg the moral

Fate
What is it left can't you say
Who will be left to pay
When ugly crippled eyes remain

Fine
Closed off devoured the meat inside of me
In freeing all afraid of life eternity

Eyes
Burning of sorrow deep craving inside no teeth
Holding on nothing left to be believed

Fear
What will we want with fear
The time of bombing near
With nothing left to have or hope for

Pain
What is there left to say
An ancient plan to pay
With blood and shit tomorrow

Shame
We will be learning shame
Until we play the game
That in the end will bring disorder

Race
What will be left to say
When nothing is the same
And all this shit goes over

"Where you...nowhere...like you left...go...where you "

Stepping out behind mask
Kiss the mercantile abscess
Run behind (teach fertile?) blood
The fingernails are dirty

Face the combination loss
And go toward the final cost
A cripple's desk, a lost foothold
Suffering at the end scene

Fine
Closed off devoured the meat inside of me
In freeing all afraid of life eternity

"Get in line...no you can't, my my....happily remove one body...nearly knew.
It's not dead...every way it's not lice laden where you going to go."
