Rocking Your Body
Baby, don't you see I came to rock your body
You know what I want so don't be shy with me girl
Move your soul to my own heart
Feel the beat inside me
Let the night last till morning light
Baby, rock it tonight

Chorus:
Sweet lil' lady rocking your body
Feel my heartbeat beating like a drum
Sweet lil' lady rocking your body

Baby, can't you see your making my heart catch on fire
Let my passion run through your lonely desire
Move your soul to the beat of my heart
And let me guide you around girl
Have no shame, whatever you do be free
Why don't you rock it with me

Chorus

Just thinking, what ---
Why am I so hooked on your girl
I can't control my heart
Since you started with me
Let the music play
Music sets you free
I need to rock your body
Baby, can't you see

Sweet lil' lady rocking your body
Feel my heartbeat beating like a drum
Sweet lil' lady rocking your body
Touch my soul girl

Chorus

Rocking your body, baby rock it tonight
