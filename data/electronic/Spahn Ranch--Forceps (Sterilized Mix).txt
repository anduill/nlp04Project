the machines hum turning
delivering the paper
so you can see the world
in another race
beside the peace officer
the man bled honestly
it's all a raising vain
the forceps used to play
you got to crawl
so you can see the world in another race
you got to crawl
so you can see the world
arthritic drag to the druggist
food or pain?
each eyes sleeping pills
browning walls no promise
mainline christ
arthritic drag to the druggist
food or pain?
TV guides and pills
