Ain't it strange
I will call out your name
I'm that silence again
Can we never win?
I will smile within
'Cause you were bad within
But I'm letting go
Giving in 

'cause I still love you

I'm gonna call out your name 

I need to breathe
I need you to succeed
I'm gon'silence again
'Cause it's love I feel
I been eager to say
I'm immune to pain
Every breathe
These chains I leave again

'cause I still love you

I'm gonna call out your name
