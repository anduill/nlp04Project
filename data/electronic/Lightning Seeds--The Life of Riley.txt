The Life Of Riley
Lost in the Milky Way,
smile at the empty sky and wait for
the moment a million chances may all collide.
I'll be the guiding light,
swim to me through stars that shine down,
and call to the sleeping World as they fall to Earth.

So here's your life,
we'll find our way,
we're sailing blind,
but it's certain nothing's certain.

I don't mind,
I get the feeling
you'll be fine,
I still believe 
that in this World,
we've got to find the time...
for the Life of Riley.

>From cradles and sleepless nights,
you breathe in life forever,
and stare at the World from deep under eiderdown.
Although this World is a crazy ride,
you just take your seat and hold on tight.

So here's your life,
we'll find our way,
we're sailing blind,
but it's certain nothing's certain.

I don't mind,
I get the feeling
you'll be fine,
I still believe 
that in this World,
we've got to find the time...
for the first time...

3. Blowing Bubbles

A whole night...
of talking in circles,
searching for the reasons to save us,
and keep it all painless.

All the lies you've had to swallow,
just to face the World tomorrow...

Blowing bubbles it's the final straw,
they never last too long but for a moment
there's perfection floating through an open door,
but if you try to hold it
then it turns to nothing.

Your whole world...
can turn on a moment,
some things can come back and haunt you,
but they're too late to warn you.

Drinking in the dead of night,
tobacco clouds that sting your eyes,
you've locked your feelings deep inside,
growing pains that never die.
You need to sweep the picture clean,
and start to dream another dream,
and end this this foggy yesterday that
still reminds you...

All the lies you've had to swallow,
just to face the World tomorrow
