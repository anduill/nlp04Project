My world was so wonderful
Anarchy from Rome to Hull
I was born for this
All I want is this
At seventeen, I used to play guitar
I never knew I could dream so hard
And though it feels like it was yesterday
And though my heroes have got overweight
I'm still waiting for the world to change

My life was like a fairy tale
Lydon roared and Roxy wailed
I was born for this
All I want is this

And since those times you know I've had some fun
I've been happy with the things I've done
But I can't resist
And sometimes I think of this

Coz there's a little piece of me
Somewhere in my memory
I love the world for being strange
And times have changed
But I think I still feel the same

There's a little piece of me
Somewhere in my memory
I love the world for being strange
Times have changed
But I think I still feel the same

And there will always be anarchy in my heart
I hope that the end for me will live up to the start
