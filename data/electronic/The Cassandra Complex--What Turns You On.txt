My name is Ted Bundy
I was a really nice guy
Till I discovered girls
Discovered they should die
I used to capture girls
I liked to see them dead
But now that I've been caught
I've found Jesus instead

What turns you on?

I liked to dig the ground
I liked to see the dead
And when I came in them
It's like Jesus giving head
Jesus is so good
Jesus is so true
Jesus, oh Jesus
I do it for you

What turns you on?

I want to tell you all
I want to testify
Don't think I would lie
Just 'cause I'm gonna fry
The pictures of those girls
Took away my shame
Took away my morals
And the Devil came
