You don't need to give me reasons
I understand
Some things are best kept secret
and you've done all you can
I want no recompense
just as much as you can give of yourself
and nothing else

And I'll keep it confidential
It's secret, confidential
It may come as some surprise
but I can stay secret from prying eyes
so don't worry I'll keep this confidential
between you and me

Go on tell me that you love me
Tell me you dare
We may not venture out in public
At least I know you care
I want no guarantees
just as much as you can give of yourself
That's all I need

And I'll keep it confidential
It's secret, confidential
It may come as some surprise
but I can stay secret from prying eyes
so don't worry I'll keep this confidential
between you and me

It's secret, so secret

You play some silly games
and if everyone knew about us
I'd feel no shame

But I'll keep it confidential
It's secret, confidential
It may come as some surprise
but I can stay secret from prying eyes
so don't worry I'll keep this confidential
between you and me
between you and me
