(Spoken)
It happened, that thing happened, that magic happened, that night

(1st Verse)
Something's coming over me 
Haven't been the same since that evening
That I put eyes on you 
Filled me with life changing feelings 
Now its all a memory 
Where you are is a mystery 
I'll do almost anything...
To get back to that night 

(Chorus)
I miss you 
I wish that you were here with me 
It felt so true 
But it only happened that night
(It only lasted that night) 
Only that night 

(2nd Verse)
Instant chemistry 
Something like a spiritual connection 
You felt it too 
That's why your body came in my direction 
Was it all a dream?
Since then your face i haven't seen 
I'll do almost anything...
To get back to that night 
(chorus)

(Bridge)
Why do you have to be so far away far away 
Wish i could be with you everyday (everyday) 
Was it real or was I imagining things? 
I'll do almost anything (anything)
To get back to that night 
(chorus)

(Fade Out)
Get back to that night babe 
Get back to that night babe 
It only happened that night babe 
It only happened that night babe
