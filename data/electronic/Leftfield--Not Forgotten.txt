The Rapture
Not Forgotten
You buried it so deep
so safe in hidden sleep
But like a tell-tale corpse
rises to the surface
over-ripe & bloated
in naked time-lapsed truth
Thought it was lost forever
Remember this

How long has it been
or have you forgotten
when you first forgot?
Now resurrection the phoenix
aflame with pride & conceit
Remembers this

Wind blown trees outside
applauding like the ocean
to the cacophony inside
The waves come rushing in
A crashing whispering
drowning they drink me

Ah not forgotten
This is not forgotten
Remember this

The Rapture
Not Forgotten
