See it coming
At my head
I'm not running
I'm not scared

Big black monsoon
Take me with you

I'm not jerking
I won't hide
Yeah, I'm ready
Meet ze monsta tonight

Big black monsoon
Take me with you ... Ow!

What a monsta
What a night
What a lover
What a fight

Big black monsoon
Take me with you

Yeah it's coming
Out of this world
Yeah, I'm lucky
Lucky girl

Hell ain't half full
Take me with you

Big black monsoon
Take me with you
