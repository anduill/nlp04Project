Let secret lips forget they have met
I really want to sleep, dream with all of you
Sleep with you tonight and throughout your life
I want you

I went to the dance
'Cause she said, dancing makes you free
You were dancing with a friend
And your friend she noticed me

I asked her to ask you
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe it's real
Or is it something in between?
Understanding how we feel
I asked her to ask you

I want a sort of truth, feel so true
And run it through my mind out of time
I found another world here inside
The tape recorder plays the terrace sways
I want you

Let secret lips forget they have met
I really want to sleep, dream with all of you
