I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure


The sound flew in the bare room, the ride's no longer spare
And time will always fall apart in a house where they don't care
We fantasized your life
And recognized the sins
But it's *** for tat, you take the rap
Now it's me that's gonna win

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure

You've got chalk on the sidewalk, and the telephone always rings
I'd rip the cord out, pull the wire out, kick it on the shins
You paralysed the gold mine
And the trains are standing still
They pull you back and now you're trapped
As they move in for the kill
(For the kill) 

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure
I can't stand the day that you wake me, I feel pressure
(Release me)
I can't stand the way that you break me, under pressure
(Release me)

Everytime I walk out in the sun the rain will come and really cry

Release me

We found you in the spare room with your eyes no longer there
The lamp flex led up to your heart like a divers cord for air
We electrolysed your mind
And analyzed your limbs
Escapist crap, I've had all that
Now it's me that's gonna win
(I'm gonna win) 

I can't stand the way that you make me, I feel pressure
I can't stop the way that you place me, under pressure
I can't stand the day that you wake me, I feel pressure
I can't stand the way that you break me, under pressure
(Release me)

I can't stand the way you disgrace me, I feel pressure
(Release me)
I can't stop the way that you hate me, I feel pressure
(Release me)

Everytime I walk out in the sun the rain will come and really cry

Now I can't be me at all
Now I can't be me at all
Now I can't be me at all
