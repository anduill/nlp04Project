Daylight burns on my eyes

And i face them on you.

And i bless the morning sun your here with me.

I know today was meant to be.



Summertime was always fine with me

But now your here, its beautiful.

Summertime was always fine with me

But now your here, its wonderful.



All night long we had shared each others lives.

Now i see the love light shine and shine in your beautiful eyes.

And i bless the morning sun your here with me.

I know today was meant to be.



Summertime was always fine with me

But now your here, its beautiful.

Summertime was always fine with me

But now your here, its wonderful.
