Lost in the future
Looking for adventure
Waiting for a stranger
To make a new connection

Everybody heading in the wrong direction
I just wanna know your name
Even if it comes to a little affection
Even if it 's now or then

Lost in the future
Looking for adventure
Waiting for a stranger
To make a new connection

Everybody heading in the wrong direction
I just wanna know your name
Even if it comes to a little affection
Even if it 's now or then

And your name, and your name
I just wanna know your name
And your name, and your name
I just wanna know your, know your
I know your, I know your name
I know your, I know your
I know your, I know your name

Lost in the future, lost in the future
Looking for adventure, looking for adventure
Waiting for a stranger, waiting for a stranger,
To make a new connection, to make a new connection

Ad lib.

Everybody heading the wrong direction
I just wanna know your name
Even if it comes to a little affection, even if it's now or then

And your name
I just wanna know your name
And your name
I just wanna know your
And your name
I just wanna know your name
And your name
I just wanna know your
I know your
