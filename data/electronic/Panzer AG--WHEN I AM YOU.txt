When I am you
I never need to care for me
When I am you
I love myself just like you
When I'm you
I kill my brain and think like you
When I'm you
I never need to hold it back

When I'm you
I kill
I'm you
I'm drugged
I'm you
It's not my fault
I'm you
I kill
I'm you
I rape and it's not my fault
I am you
When I am you
