It never works that's what they say
A million fools have tried it and failed
Why do we hurt each other so much
Chasing the glory the glory of love

Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love

The vows of lovers are never kept
So quick to love you, so quick to forget
And when they hurt you, you love to be hurt
Ain't no cure for the sickness of love

Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love

We must be dameged infected with pain
Romance, narcosis, one and the same
I wanna sleep and never wake up
And dream of glory, the glory of love

Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, uh huh huh huh huh
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
Uh huh huh huh huh, the glory of love
