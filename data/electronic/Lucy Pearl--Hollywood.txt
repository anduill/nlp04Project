What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree

What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree

What you want me to be Hollywood
Where is the money honey
I swear I've asked that question a thousand times
They use ya, rip through your soul

While they funk with your mind anxious
For the fame that you dream all about
Fool ya
Fame is gone ain't no one to be found

I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree

What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood

What you want me to be Hollywood
Like a cheating man's mission
They take you out commission
Suck you dry and then move onto the next

Fill your head with stardom promises
Make their money then they leave you for dead
Still believing the ones who are deceiving 
Got ya starvin' while they already ate

Sign your life on the dotted line
'Stead of giving all the money they make Hollywood
I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood

I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood
I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood

I don't agree
What you want me to be Hollywood
