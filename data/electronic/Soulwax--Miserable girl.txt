Taking your time,
Answering eyes,
And you're thinking of why
Instead of about.
And it's taking up time,
You never had.
And you're making up like,
Nothing is said.

There were all these cries,
And don't ask whys,
A kiss will never taste like goodbye.
And it's almost fine,
But all this time,
The feeling is so hard to deny.

Why not till it's over?

You're just a miserable girl,
Trapped in a healthy body. (x2)
You're such a catholic girl,
Trapped in a guilty body.
