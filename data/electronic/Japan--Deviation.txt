Delivering protests of intellect
And persevere over singular verbs
Your head is fucked and the sequel is indirect
And we don't know which way to turn

Still we had fun, fun, fun, fun
While you're dancing
We had fun, fun, fun, fun
With you all

We had fun, fun, fun
While you're dancing
And we'll have fun, fun, fun
When you go

Deviation, step on your fingers
Deviation, step on your toes
Deviation, step on your fingers
Deviation comes and goes

Engineering love on the autobahn
Germanic hands positioned by you
They're making love without precision
And we don't know just what to do
