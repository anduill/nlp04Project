No more hunger 
to walk or cry
No anger 
to walk or cry 
It´s the answer 
to walk or cry 
Tripping souls 
will always die 

I don´t feel higher 
to walk or cry
In my desire 
to walk or cry
To be a liar 
to walk or cry)
Giving souls 
will always die 

It´s a lifeline 
to walk or cry 
A goodtime 
to walk or cry 
This life´s mine 
to walk or cry 
Tripping souls 
will always die 

I sold my mother 
to walk or cry 
To pay my lover 
to walk or cry 
I´ll get another 
to walk or cry

wrap me up and 
cover me in love 
be in me as one, 
never wake me up 
let the darkness come 

cover me in love 
be in me as one, 
never wake me up 
let the darkness come
