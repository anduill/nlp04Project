Here is life, all into one

in moments such as this

All that lives and breathes under the sun

is part of heaven's kiss

And we'll fly

to meet the dawn

in crimson skies

we will be with one

Each of us from day to day

so often deaf and blind.

Awareness of the deeper way

in nature's presence find

And we'll fly

to meet the dawn

in crimson skies

we will be with one.
