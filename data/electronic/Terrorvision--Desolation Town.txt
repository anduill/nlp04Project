in a cold and lonely hotel room,
I think of you all the time,
My car was built the same year Hendrix died,
My mom just cried when I told her.
So good to see you again,
Take my hand and go.

I'm going down to Desolation town,
I'm going down to Desolation town.

Four walls of stains and names that I don't know,
I'll call my home for a while,
Time took its cigarette and broke its bones,
Bet Davey Jones didn't know he was in this song.

So good to see you again,
Take my hand and go.

I'm going down to Desolation town,
I'm going down to Desolation town.
