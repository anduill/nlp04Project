Nothing is true
Except you
Make one mistake, you're on trial
Make one mistake, I'll be there
Make one mistake, I'll come running
In the middle of the night, I'll kill your dreams
Nothing is true
Ecstasy is the key
Ecstasy
Last night I met a great big man
Walking in the shadows of my mind
We sat and talked for a little while
He showed me his foot, I showed him my scars
We went out into the country
To see the night, to see the stars
To see the night, to touch the stars
To see the light, to be the stars
Ecstasy
Nothing is true
Ecstasy is the key
Ecstasy
