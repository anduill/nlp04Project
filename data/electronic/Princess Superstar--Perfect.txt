I'm comin' straight out the N-Y-C
Every single little bad boy's wet dream featurin' me
Cream get the money, dollar dollar bill y'all
Kill y'all, got the ill jaw, ex's still call
You know I gotta do whatever it takes
All them other chicks it's like that's the breaks
And all them other chicks wanna take my place
And all them other chicks better get out my face
The look, the lips, the tits, the taste
The hair, the eyes, the skin, the waist
You see what I can do on this microphone
So this what I'm gonna do to you at home
Get goin' with the mastercard
Max it hard in the backs of cars
Faxin' lawyers, racks and racks at stores

Hey I don't mean to brag but I'm makin' ladies mad
When they look at what I have, all the shit in my bag
Runnin' things like a track, no patience
Got you starvin' for me like a Hollywood actress
So attractive, wear my dresses backless
Flippin' lots of heavy words like a matress
Make money during napses, leg hair waxes
Use hundred dollar bills, got a million pairs of underwear
Millionaire times my strands of hair
It's all there, bull or bear, I don't know and I don't care
It ain't fair, it's the Superstar, make 'em stop and stare
Runnin' scared, kiss my derriere, on my mirrored chair
[Yo, why you got a mirrored chair]
You can see my ass much better there, to kiss it, kiss it
