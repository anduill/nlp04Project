Don't make me lose the will to love
Just to satisfy your broken dreams
This is obvious that enough's enough
Please don't make me lose the will to love

You can run away, just run away
But it's obvious you're fake
As any Valentine's Day
I don't need no more of your Hollywood smile
Sweet talk, cheap cars
Just not my style baby, not my smile

Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside your head all day
The jealousy, the lies
The billion empty words you say
It's funny how I stumbled on the truth the other day
Your best friend gave it all away

Don't make me lose the will to love
Just to satisfy your broken dreams
This is obvious that enough's enough
Please don't make me lose the will to love

Don't make me lose the will to love
Just to satisfy your broken dreams
This is obvious that enough's enough
Please don't make me lose the will to love

You can smile away, just smile away
In the haven of your sleep
You're king for a day
And I sit all night in the corner of the room
Head down, heart gone
Watching you like the saddest tune

I could pretend it never happened, look the other way
My broken heart is full of doubt there's nothing I can say
It's strange how people never notice other people's pain
They always look the other way

Don't make me lose the will to love
Just to satisfy your broken dreams
This is obvious that enough's enough
Please don't make me lose the will to love

How can it be, you said the fault lies with me
When black and blue, it's all been down to you
When all the time, you say you love is divine
With each blow you reinforce what I've always known
