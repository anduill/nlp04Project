To the left to the right
Step it up, step it up it’s alright
To the left and to the right
Check the new ride out it’s alright
Silence ain’t in season
'Cause there ain’t no good in grief
Can’t stop my mouth form breathin’
Or seein’ what I see
Curves with destinations
Poetic symmetry
Ya 'cause an inflammation
In my anatomy, don’t you see, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, you can’t send a forget-me-not
Yeah yeah yeah, but I’ll still reach up to the top
Yeah yeah yeah, until the last day that I drop
Yeah yeah yeah, this is something you can’t stop
From infancy I grown
The message that I’m givin’
You don’t have to be alone, no you don’t
Cos days may come and go come and go
You’ll see no sight or sound
But when your mind is willing
You’ll find that I’ll be around
Hear me sayin’, hear me sayin’
Yeah yeah yeah, you can’t send a forget-me-not
Yeah yeah yeah, but I’ll still reach up to the top
Yeah yeah yeah, until the last day that I drop
Yeah yeah yeah
To the left to the right
Keep it goin’ keep it goin’ it’s alright
To the left and to the right
Step it up, step it up it’s alright
We want flesh

Ah, ah, ah
All you gotta do is bounce it
To see just what goes where
There ain’t no way around it
So I have come well prepared don’t you know
I’m in you form the outset
Hip to hip and dome to dome
We reach the outer limits
Bring the boogie boogie home back home
Yeah yeah yeah, you can’t send a forget-me-not
Yeah yeah yeah, but I’ll still reach out to the top
Yeah yeah yeah, we’re goin’ right around the clock
Yeah yeah yeah
To the left and to the right
Step it up, step it up it’s alright
To the left and to the right
