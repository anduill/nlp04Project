With morning hair I lie and stare
At the time through glassy eyes
And I'd love to stay in disarray
But the sun had the nerve to rise

And I smile proud to please the crowd
Do you think I look nice?
And all I wear is my despair
Beneath today's disguise

I say what I mean, but I never mean what I say
Am I alive, or am I just awake?

You will never know who I really am inside
You only see what I can't hide
And if you even see that much
Then stop right there, that's close enough

Can you stand to be around me?
Well that makes one of us
I don't deserve your company
And I don't deserve your trust

I say what I mean, but I never mean what I say
Am I alive, or am I just awake?

You will never know who I really am inside
You only see what I can't hide
And if you even see that much
Then stop right there, that's close enough

I say what I mean, but I never mean what I say
Am I alive, or am I just wake?
I've got time, if you don't mind
Here's one more cliche:
I'm so close, yet so far away

And you will never know who I really am inside
You only see what I can't hide
And if you even see that much
Then stop right there, that's close enough
