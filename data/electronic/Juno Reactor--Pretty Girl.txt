You had it all, until the fall, now winters setting in
How warm the days, now far away, never to return
I spend my days in city graves and the dead just keep on talking
They can't disguise their soulless lives
Oh their hardships I keep yawning

Oh pretty thing
Oh pretty girl

Tender times, love it shines, on a cool golden breeze
I close my eyes. I realize the feelings

CHORUS
Oh Pretty Girl. Sail across the world
Oh Pretty Girl. Sail across the world

Joe he sang for the Queen in Penang
Like diamonds he shone for years

Oh Pretty Girl. Sail across the world
Oh Pretty Girl. Sail across the world
