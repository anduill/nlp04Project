And her hallway
Moves
Like the ocean
Moves
At the head of the river
At the source of the sea

Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Tryin' to write it down
Fitting in hard with harder to come
Tryin' to fight it
Down the river there's a ship will carry you
Down river, down stream
Down the river there's a ship will carry the dream

Dream of the flood
Down the river there's a ship will carry the
Dream of the flood

And her hallway
As the water come rushing over
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over
Flood, flood

Push the glass, stain the glass
Push the writer to the wall
It may come but it will pass
Some say we will fall
Dream of flood

Hush
And her hallway
Hush

Oh, maybe in terms of surrender
On a backcloth of lashes and eyes
In a flood of your tears in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies

Hush
And her hallway
Hush
Like, like, like
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over

Sitting here now in this bar for hours
While these strange men rent strange flowers
I'll be picking up your petals in another few hours
In the metal and blood in the scent and mascara

On a backcloth of lashes and stars
In a flood of your tears in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and secondhand passion
And stolen guitars

And her hallway
Hush
As the water come rushing in
Like the sea
As the water come rushing over
Dream of the flood

In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies
As the water come rushing in, rushing in

At the head of the river
At the source of the sea
And her hallway
(Flood)
Like flood
Like
(Flood)
