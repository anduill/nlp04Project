The sadness comes when it's least expected 
It shot out of the dark, and slammed in our face 
The hurt it brings can't be stopped 
The hurt it brings can't be cured, oh 

Just when I thought things were alright 
You came and ripped out my heart 
My stomach's full of butterflies 
The thought of you gone, it tears me apart 

I remember you and me when we used to 
Laugh all night until we fell asleep, oh 
And i know we're through 
But i've still got thoughts of you left inside my head 

Well... in my head... 

The love that I have for you 
Is done and dead, it's so far away 
And you're still here in my head 
And you're still here, you'll never leave my heart 

Just when I thought things were alright 
You came and ripped out my heart 
My stomach's full of butterflies 
The thought of you gone, it tears me apart 

I remember you and me when we used to 
Laugh all night until we fell asleep, oh 
And i know we're through 
But i've still got thoughts of you left inside my head 

So stop me now 
Stop my thoughts cause you're killin me 
But you don't know 
Even though we've grown apart 
I'll still be there for you 
Cause I don't wanna be just a memory to you 
Cause I don't wanna be just a memory to you
