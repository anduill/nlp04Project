Broken knuckles and two black eyes
A bleeding nose, you should have seen the other guys

It's Iggy

You always see him speeding but never in a car
Sweating bullets and leaning against the bar

It's Marvin

Dreaded cross dresser bearing down on you
What's he gonna say, what's he gonna do?

Mad and I

Are you wearing your girlfriend's lipstick again?
You're sure got a bad eye there, jammy dodger
