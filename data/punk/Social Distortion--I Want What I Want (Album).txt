I wanted a vintage Harley
I wanted a house with a yard
I wanted a pocket full of money and
A wardrobe of clothes with style
My style-

[Chorus]
Because I want what I want
And I want it now
You mean this great big world
Doesn't revolve around me?

I wanted a '55 Cadillac
Sittin' low, chromed and shiny black
But then somebody told me
The best things in life aren't things

[Chorus]
