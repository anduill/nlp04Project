A look of discontentment fills your hazel eyes
as I ask for the millionth time what's goin' on?
you seem to be confused
about just where you stand with me tonight
as we tear apart all that wasn't lost to another fight
and so we turn against each other
once again you run and I go hide
talkin' to myself again
bout all the things I should've said
and I wait for you
I wanna know where this is going
and do we still have a chance
to save what we haven't lost again
I made a promise to myself not to let this go
but now I need to see this through
to burn these paper walls of doubt
[Chorus]
My fucked up head is spinning round
and all my thoughts just keep me down
here on your doorstep
I'm drunk again
I know you're sick of all my shit
and I know you wanna end this
so tell me right now where do you stand?
I know your tired of this waiting game
and I know your tired of all my ways
I know your tired of it all
just tell me now
I wanna know where this is going
and do we still have a chance
to save what we haven't lost
inside all these paper walls we build
and all the ashes that have spilled get in the way
[Chorus]
