A cheap transistor radio underneath my pillow,
I fell asleep to the hits,
And I woke up with batteries dead,
But it was worth it cuz I love music,
And it’s better when it’s free.
Much like it felt back in the 70’s.
Cheap! Tran! Sistor! Radio!
Possibilities seemed endless,
as to what was what and what could be
I think that it is very important,
To continue that line of thinking,
Come on tell me,
Do you agree? Or do you disagree?
Come on tell me, honestly.

Cheap! Tran! Sistor! Radio! Yeah!
Cheap Tran! Sistor! Radio!
Underneath my pillow! [x5]
