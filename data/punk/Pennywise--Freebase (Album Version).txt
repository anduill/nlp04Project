I got some shit for sale you oughtta get some
You'll be the highest guy that ever lived
It might kill you man you won't even know it
I can feel your best sense starting to give
You take the chance you lose control
The lessons from your past you need to know
Take one more hit of base
That shit is gonna blow up in your face
Ripping glass shards through your heart
You got a problem man you ought to fix it
You think you're geting hig
Until it's too late well you wont even know it
You better stop before you hit a dead end
When I see you out on the street
A different story everytime we meet
You been hanging with a different crowd
Your acting tough and your talking loud
It's getting worse for you every single day
A bad habit and it won't go away
Where you gone where's my best friend
I can't help you cause you won't let me in
