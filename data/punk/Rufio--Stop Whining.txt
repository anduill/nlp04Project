so close to 
no one that 
you care for 
cause you don't care 
it's not worth it 
can't think straight 
so take your pill 
and stop whining 
so close your eyes 
and think of your lies 
behind the wall 
of innocence lost 
think of family 
and think of your friends 
think about all these thoughts will be gone when you're dead... dead 

always feel discomfort 
always feel alone well who cares about it 
cant find a 
good reason 
to stay here 
so stop whining 
so close your eyes 
and think of your lies 
behind the wall 
of innocence lost 
think of family 
and think of your friends 
think about all these thoughts will be gone 

if you really did 
want to end your life 
you'd be gone by now 
it's just a cop out 
you can't pull through 
you don't know what to do 
you analyze it 
but you can't see straight 
you don't know what to think 
don't blame your shit on me 
it's getting older these days 
just keep on passing by 
leave me alone 

so close your eyes 
and think of your lies 
behind the wall innocence lost 
think of family 
and think of your friends 
think about all these thoughts will be gone when you're dead... dead
