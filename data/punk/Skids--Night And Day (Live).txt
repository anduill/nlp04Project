The city lights are dying,
Two burning suns cruise west,
Stomachs taught,
With the smack of wine
Left behind the streets of sweat,
Bled a thousand times
Living in the alleys of grime,
Kids made of steel
Who never give,
Muscle and blood
To stay and live
Stay and live
Stay and live
Stay and live
Stay and live

An encounter on the highway,
A woman in an injured machine
Several numbers,
One wave thought
To steal some fun in a single shot,
The screams lost in the distance
No city tears were shed,
The Boss-man sheriff
So far away,
As the car pulled off and
The night turned day
Night turned day
Night turned day
Night turned day
Night turned day

Night turned day
Night turned day

Night turned day

Night turned day

Night turned day

Night turned day
