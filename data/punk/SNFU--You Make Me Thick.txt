I'm a talking, walking stick
Blow me over in the wind
I want to be paper thin
I want to fart through silk

Head in the toilet bowl
Two fingers down my throat
Vomit dripping off of my lips
Stop trying to make me thick

Kate Moss is my role model
One high priced bag of bones
Tell me, is she chic? 
or just a glamorous freak

Face down in the toilet bowl
Two fingers stuck
Down my slimy throat
Stop trying to make me thick
