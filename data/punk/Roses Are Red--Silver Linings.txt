Your intentions wrapped and sealed carefully
Patiently my eyes will follow line by line
Paint a picture where you'd rather be tonight
Honestly it seems we're running out of time

You know, I know and I can tell
Silver linings that you wear so well
If we knew now what we knew then
We'd pass regret into the night again

I can taste it on your lips the way you never needed this
Please give me something to forget

You know, I know and I can tell
Silver linings that you wear so well
If we knew now what we knew then
We'd pass regret into the night again
I told you then, I'll tell you now
I'll find a way to make you mine somehow
