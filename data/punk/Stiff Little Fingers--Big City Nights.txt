Stop and go on an empty crossing The lights keep changing to only their hum And standing in line along the kerb The bin bags wait till the morning comes
You hear yourself walk echo lonely See shadows move in every door Are you sure that's your own footsteps behind? Is there really nothing to turn round for?
And you feel that you're always gonna walk The city streets all on your own The night is dark as a car crawls by And the road goes on and on
They don't even care about you They never even think about you 'Cos they're gonna do without you and you're gone Just another big city night
Over your shoulder, round every corner Remember what's happened to people you've known Watch for yourself, 'cos no one else will You're gonna get it if you're alone
Suddenly a stab from a knife out of nowhere Jumped from behind like they always do It only makes one line in the paper you read Somebody got it but it was you
And you feel that you're always gonna walk The city streets all on your own The night is dark as a car crawls by And the road goes on and on
They don't even care about you They never even think about you 'Cos they're gonna do without you and you're gone Just another big city night
Just another big city night Who's it gonna be tonight?
