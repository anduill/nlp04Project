Don't wait until it's too late
Everyone is gone
Everyone is here
I won't wake up to find myself alone
Lying on a bed of nails
And try to figure out what went wrong
So all my life destroy my mind
Give me all drugs you have
One more shot and I'll be dead
All this time and I'm still alive
Take one step in front of me
Don't look back or you will open up the world
That's rolling around inside your room
And let the monsters out
Open up the world that's rolling around inside your head
And let yourself out
I can't even try to change the past
Cause everywhere I walk they will follow me
Everything then seen inside of me is a piece of something
Something that they will never be
