ou're only 29
Gotta lot to learn
about when your business dies
you will not return

we like noise, it's a choice
it's what we wanna do
we don't care about long hair
we go with flares

see my face, it's not a trace
no reality
I don't work
I just speed that's all that I need

I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod
I'm a lazy sod

Lazy

I'm a lazy sod
I'm not a lazy snood
I'm a lazy sod

Lazy!
