We're urban savages, no one can manage us
We're gonna hit the street
We're urban savages, no one can manage us
We gotta rock the street

Locked inside your city like I'm locked inside your cage
Capitalist corruption is oozing off my brain
Put locks on your cities, put locks on your stores
Gonna burn your city down right on the floor

Locked inside a city like a bird locked in a cage.
Capitalist corruption turning into rage
Put locks on your cities and locks on your floor
Gonna burn your city down and I'm no fool

Trapped inside a system like a bird locked in a cage
Capitalist corruption has got me turning up in pain
Better lock up your system, better lock up your door
Gonna burn your city down onto the floor

Escape!
