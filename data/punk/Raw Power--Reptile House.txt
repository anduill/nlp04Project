like a snake slithers, on the ground
you slither at my feet
just like a lizard, changes his skin
you change your side
IT'S A REPTILE HOUSE
just like a snake, has a forked tongue
you lie all the time
just like a lizard, lies in the sun
you lie on your back
IT'S A REPTILE HOUSE
no use trying to get away,
it's a reptile house
IT'S A REPTILE HOUSE
