It's gone the safest escape, no trace of recognition 
I spot some fragments, but its to distant 
I feel it burning close, there's no difference 
afraid to let you inside, but it's just to persistent 
When I inhale to scream, I feel no strength in my body 
I feel numb and weak, I've lost again 
Sometimes I'm afraid to try and sometimes try is all I can do 
Afraid to connect, to reach joy 
what was the lowest price that I could possibly pay 
I shudder to reflect on it, I try to let it fade 
its coming on again, too strong to deny, breathe and make another try 
How do we define strength to carry on 
I haven't lost my faith, I'm still strong.
