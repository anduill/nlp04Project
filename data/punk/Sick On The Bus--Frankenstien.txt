People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
Unless they want broken windows and broken bones
Your concrete jungle's crashing, oh, what a fucking shame
You created this monster and Frankenstein's his name

You're gonna get what you fucking deserve
Frankenstein is coming to destroy your world

Monster or fucking loser, it's all the fucking same
I do what I do for fun and not financial gain
I've never killed nobody, does it make you feel a man?
Then we can walk together through the city of the damned

You're gonna get what you fucking deserve
Frankenstein is coming to destroy your world

Vodka pills and powder, all money down the drain
I could have been somebody but instead I've gone insane
My body's shutting down, cracked under strain
I created this monster and Frankenstein is my name

I'm gonna get what you fucking deserve
Frankenstein is coming to destroy my world
