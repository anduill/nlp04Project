All is quiet all is dead The city has melted The sound has penetrated Through our heads The world has ended the gas is gone It killed the people now the mutants live on
Chorus: So long to the world That's what they said It's 1984 and it's all gone dead
There is no England Anarchy is right But don't contradict Or try to fight It's always dark there is no light And 77 has rose to its height
Chorus
They shouldn't have brought back hanging It caused a lot of fuss No one could trust the government We had the fuckers sussed There are no banks left They've all gone bust And the houses of Parliament is just a pile of dust
Chorus
It's 1984 and there's gonna be a war War...War..There is fucking war
