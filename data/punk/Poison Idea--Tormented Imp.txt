Don't see the picture
Couldn't read the caption
Read your eyes like paper
You turned fast I can't remember
Humiliation abundant
Almost like the last time
But you always act so humble
I don't know what's on your mind
First side, swing to the left
I like it best, then I look
After me or the rest
Then I swing to the right
You say its wrong, no man is free
who can't sing this song
Tormention no question
Surrender. Get the picture?
Look me right in the eyes
Tell me the truth and give me a smile
Imp that's all it means
