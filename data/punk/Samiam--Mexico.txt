You wanna be some place warm,
Probably Mexico,
Even though it's really not that cold.
You been planning a girl-girl trip in a motor home.
You wanna see how it feels to leave.

You wanted to see just how good it feels to leave,
Never mind the mess you left behind.
You wanted to see just how good it feels to leave,
To leave everything behind.

A chance to breathe,
A little time of your own,
It don't really matter where you’re going.
I’ll buy you some magazines, 
You can call me from the roadside phone,
Let me know when you're coming home.

You know where to find me.
Whenever you decide. 
And you know that I’ll be here when you get home...
Do you know if I’ll be here?

You wanted to see just how good it feels to leave,
Never mind the mess you left behind.
You wanted to see just how good it feels to leave.
