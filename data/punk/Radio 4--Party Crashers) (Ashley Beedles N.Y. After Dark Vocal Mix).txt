Well, I see you around town You got no time for dressing down The day's headlines, all suit you fine, oh You make your way right through the crowd
Invisible eyes are everywhere You check your coat, they check your hair You new line fashion and you put on passion Don't seem to get you anywhere
Well all the party crashers And all the party crashers And all the party crashers, yeah They send a message across this town
The DJ is in from overseas You're breaking hearts, he's making beats Your hands are shaking as you hit the pavement Can't catch a break on 13th street
And I say, "These days things seems strange" Oh now, these days things seems strange They're taking over while we think it over Can't get a message anyway
To all the party crashers And all the party crashers And all the party crashers, yeah They send a message across the town, woh
And all the party crashers Yeah all the party crashers And all the party crashers Well all the party crashers
Well, they let me down down down down down They let me down down down down down They let me down down down down down They let me down down down down down They let me down
