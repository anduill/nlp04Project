Dance and laugh and play. Ignore the message we convey.
It seems we're only here to entertain.
A rebellion cut-to-fit. I refuse to be the soundtrack to it.
While we entertain we're still knee-deep in shit.
There's something wrong inside.
We've played it safe, enjoyed the ride.
You won't like this but I've something to confide.
We stand for something more than a faded sticker on a skateboard.
Now we've rained on your parade and we're out the door.
And I don't even care any fucking more.
Witness this pair in accomplice.
Witness this pair; lethargic, unconscious.
No brows furrowed in question, complacent, completing their tasks
(no questions asked)
Consider this critic a cretin,
Just resting on laurels completely invented.
Word acrobatics performed with both harness and net.
I am so full of shit.
But I will remain until this self-awareness fades
Until I defeat the purpose of this soapbox that you made.
That you made.
Hope, perseverance, a vision (some doubt).
Green ink, a 26 oz., a bad case of big-mouth.
A sum of our parts and I've never laughed harder.
A song in our hearts and I've never laughed harder.
It don't really matter cuz nothing's ever felt as right as this.
(by the way, I stole this riff)
