You're so much bigger than me Though your head is full of thoughts as big as mine I'm so much smaller than you And if you've been cruel you left your footprints all over me
Not that I would've let that happen But once you've really got me under your skin Only for a short time I wanted out
And I felt so good while making you sad 'Cause you look so good when you are sad And we always knew that I was too cold for you
You're so much stronger than me You should know how to sink a ship like me I am much more weaker than you Still I think I can hurt one or two
After someone told me selfish is my first name I played tricks on him Just because I want to whenever I want to
And I felt so good while making you sad 'Cause you look so good when you are sad And we always knew that I was too cold for you
Too cold for you I am too cold for you
And I felt so good while making you sad 'Cause you look so good when you are sad And we always knew that I was too cold for you
