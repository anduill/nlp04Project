Ego-maniac traitor
You never did understand
You fell in love with your ego
It did not fit into plan

Low Life
Your alter-ego is a moron
30 years too late
No closet is private
Can see the crack in your face

Low Life
Bourgeois Anarchist
I read you despise us
Always hurt the one you love
Shit in a drain

Low Life
Ego-maniac traitor
You are a fool to yourself
You lie to be distant
Ignorant selfish
