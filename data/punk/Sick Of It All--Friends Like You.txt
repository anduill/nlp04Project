Call me a friend but you stab me in the back
you pretend we get along, it's all just an act
you always use people to get what you need
you take advantage of others to satisfy your greed
all you do is take and you never once give
don't you have any shame, the life that you live

We don't need you, you fucking scum
hope that friends like you will never come
when things turn bad for you, don't count on me
cause I'll turn my back on you as you did to me

We don't need friends like you
We don't need friends like you
We don't need friends like you
We don't need friends like you

Call me a friend but you stab me in the back
you pretend we get along, it's all just an act
you always use people to get what you need
you take advantage of others to satisfy your greed
all you do is take and you never once give
don't you have any shame, the life that you live

Like you
