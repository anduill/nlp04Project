Does time go by, was there a day When my love just wasn't quite enough? Was there ever a day I did not care? Have I ever shown you otherwise? I could not possibly love you more
Once again you're shown me, I was wrong 'Cause every day I see your face Your beautiful green eyes I find, I love you more
I have traveled this land and I've seen a lot There's nothing I've seen that could prepare The deepest ocean, the fire in the sunset I've never seen anything like them I saw you and they could not compare
Once again, you've shown me I was wrong 'Cause every day I see your face Your beautiful green eyes I find, I love you more
