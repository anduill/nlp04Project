Leave me alone I need no-one
Leave me alone I can get by on my own
I don't need you to tell me what I've gotta do today

I get up every morning to the sound of my alarm
And if that isn't enough me mum and dad is yet to come
Me mum is always moaning
That me dad is always broke
I feel sorry for me dad
He's only got his drink and his smoke

Leave me alone I need no-one
Leave me alone I can get by on my own
I don't need you to tell me what I've gotta do today

I'm sick and tired of this boring routine
It's the same everyday
I've got me mum nagging
Me boss is nagging
I'm always late for work
I don't really care
I'll still have a laugh anyway

Leave me alone I need no-one
Leave me alone I can get by on my own
I don't need you to tell me what I've gotta do today

I wish they'd understand me
But I know they never will
And eating my bloody breakfast
Won't change the way I feel
They talk about the old days
The things they never had
Well that was yesteryear mum
And this is today dad

Leave me alone I need no-one
Leave me alone I can get by on my own
I don't need you to tell me what I've gotta do tod
