a complex structure, a full circle of hate. the victory was already there
but now its too late, a harmony to achieve, in the simplest of ways
torn to shreds inside, determent to lose that fate
strength and determination, what's there to gain
an insight of inside, an attitude that will remain
a habit of standing, on a solid foundation, a reason, to carry on, is what is found
we only use the useless, then we forget
we build our lives out of nothing, the meaning seems meaningless.
