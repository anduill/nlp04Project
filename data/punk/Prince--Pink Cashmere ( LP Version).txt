Ooh, here I go again, falling in love all over
Ooh, the cycle never ends, you just pray and don't get burned
Ooh, this fire inside of me, don't nobody realize
Ooh, what you are to me, but baby you got to learn

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you, how I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute of every hour 'til you are here

Girl, can you understand, I never used to go dancing
I, I was the kind of man who rather stay at home
Now, when I think about h-how much I miss you
I wanna jump for joy and thank him I'm not alone

I'm not alone

Ooh, I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you baby how I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm gonna count every minute of every hour, until you are here

Here I go again, falling in love all over
Oh, the cycle never ends, you pray and don't get burnt

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you, how I always want you near
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
I'm counting every minute of every hour 'til you are here

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
You got to know how I feel about you
I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
Counting every minute of every hour 'til you are here

I'm making you a coat of pink cashmere
Coat of pink cashmere
Coat of pink cashmere
Coat of pink cashmere

'Cuz you got to know how I feel about you babe
How I feel about you babe, I'm gonna make a little pretty coat
I'm gonna count every second, every minute
Each and every hour of every day 'til you come on back
Come on back to your little man
