You're not telling what you feel
You just say you can't deal
You're just lying in an ????
You're just saying it ain't real

Mom told you
And i'll tell you
You better pick it up
Clean up your room

I'm not telling you what to feel
I'm just saying i can't deal
You're just lying like a peel
I'm just saying you ain't real

Your mom told you
And i'll tell you
You better straighten up
Besides you messed your [s???]

You're so hot 
You bet
Entangled

Tunafish cans, chocolate wrapper,
Jello [blobs]???, stuffed gorilla, phone bill,
Fax paper, cranberry juice, dirty socks,
Cd's, tapes, guitar pick, new snare,
High school year book
Come.....in [comb.....and]
All those letters

Your mom told you
And i'll tell you
If you make me cry
I'll poke your eye

I'll tell you ['re in for ???]
You're lying in your room
If what you say is true
Then i say we're through
