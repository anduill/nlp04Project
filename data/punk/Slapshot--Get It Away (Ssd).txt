Throw your hate to the sky We guarantee to make you smile All the things you can't deny 'Cause we come, come, come correct So protect your neck 'Cause you'll be comin' to reject Yo mic check An invitation to your door And check the score We deliver to you hardcore There's too much hype in this business So grab this, get pissed, don't diss Get down while you feed this Freeze, 32 degrees, Take the boundaries Yeah get ready for the last kiss 'Cause it's time to Open up your window We got the vibe, We comin' to you loco Here comes the sound Explodin' to your audio Here we go, We're f***in' up the scenario You think it's pretty Like another Sex in the City You're greedy, you're witty You're acting fool like you're crazy Your territory, I don't invade Without a fist of fury Here we go Be my pain You want my sensitivity You try to get away from me You want my sensitivity You try to get away
CHORUS: Way Go to get away (x3) Got to get away (x2)
I swallow, I wallow The snake doesn't rattle You kick me in the face Just to start another battle It's this place that Makes me go insane You try to program me Manipulate my brain Everyone try to beat your as* Like Sugar Ray beat Duran You go no mas, No mas, you don't trust To live is a must Ashes to ashes, dust to dust Assassinator, the hate instigator You cut me with your tongue 'Cause you're sharper than a razor Just a blink of an eye you can die You can scream in your dream You can cry, you can lie What you feel right inside I don't know how to live I don't know how to die What can you do if you know They were pushin' you back In this life, keep on track Got to know where you're at So come up, let me see How you people react Here we go Be my pain
Repeat chorus
Die alone, livin' on my own Ignore my skills but It's stickin' to your bone No limitations Step back so I can't function Be a superstar Like the Temptations
Yeah I'm your enemy Save my sanity Protect yourself Be what you wanna be (x2)
Repeat chorus
