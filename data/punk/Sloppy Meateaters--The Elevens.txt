You?re drinking on your own
Running for the coast
Running from those ghosts
Running away, girl
With one eye to your past

I see you took the stance
That now you?ve got the chance
You might as well just dance
Go skies and thrones and wings
And poetry and things

I think you?re doing fine
Don?t offer me a line
I only want a cup of tea
Go on then, just one
But I really can?t stay long

I love the way you shake
But you?ve lost a little weight
Yeah, you?ve lost a little weight
See you tomorrow, same time, same place

Mother's little helper is running for her shelter
And no one wants to know
Love dead as doornail, patient unstirred

At least that?s what they said
She?s gone away for good
She?s really made a meal
And blown the record deal
She?s blown the record deal
What are we to do?

See you tomorrow, same time, same place
I?ll see you tomorrow, same time, same place
I?ll see you tomorrow, same time, same place
I?ll see you tomorrow, same time, same place
