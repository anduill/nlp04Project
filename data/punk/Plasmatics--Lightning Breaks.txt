Lightning Breaks The Midnight Air
Light Comes Shining Down On Me
Feel The Presence Of The Force
Tidal Waves Out On The Sea
Lord Have Mercy On My Soul
Darkness Sets Me Free
Why Must I Feel These Things
Something Wrong With Me
Good Is So Bad And Bad Is So
Good
No Place Left To Hide
Can't Hide What's Inside
No Place Left To Hide
Can't Hide What's Inside
