Sun was out
the fish were swimming
in choke polluted water
all the fishes dying 
from those toxic PCB's
dumping in our stream
but we didn't give a fuck
ya know we had some
cheap American brews
ya know some nice hot dogs
figured ya know...get out the
little transistor radio,
sit back relax have a nice
little summer barbecue

It's a beautiful,
what a beautiful,
it's a beautiful, 
beautiful day,
FOR A BARBECUE!

well uh,
we uh sat back,
and down and looked into the air,
all the sudden,
said, WHAT'S THAT IN THE SKY?
is it a bird or a plane!?

Steaks are done come and get 'em 
no one miss a barbecue
big fat Cow, sizzling, dripping
Oscar Mayer, we thank you!
for a beautiful
it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful - beautiful day!
it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful - beautiful day!

For a barbecue!
this time the hot dogs is you
oh wow man, that makes me think of karma

Well as those first bombs start dropping
we wondered, where the hell is that transistor radio!
you know, turn on what the newsman has to say
about one of those a-rab countries talking 'bout a
FAILED NEGOTIATION?!

it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful-beautiful day!

For a barbecue!
