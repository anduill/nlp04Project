The long and short of it is There's no reaction Oh well the long and short of it is There's no reaction
People gather in cities world 'round See them everywhere Right to assemble and to speak out loud Don't get you on the air
And you know they hear it all And the roof's about to fall In the distance they can hear us call And they resist us but they hear the call, yeah
'Cause the long and short of it is There's no reaction I said the long and short of it is There's no reaction
Interest level in this nation's great We've been misunderstood They check you out, they want to keep you at bay And that's all well and good
And you know right where it's at Executives wear party hats But on their faces they've fallen flat Yeah, on their faces they've fallen flat
The long and short of it is The long and short of it is Oh well the long and short of it is I said the long and short of it is
Well there's no reaction No, there's no reaction And now there's no reaction, pal And now there's no reaction, pal
Here now, there's no reaction, pal There's no reaction, pal And now there's no reaction, pal No, no, there's no reaction, pal So check it
The long and short of it is The long and short of it is I said the long and short of it is
There's no reaction No, there's no reaction And now there's no reaction, pal No, no, there's no reaction, pal
Here now, there's no reaction, pal There's no reaction, pal And now there's no reaction, pal No, no, there's no reaction, pal
