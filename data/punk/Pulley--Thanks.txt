isten too, what we did in 82
Come along way so have you
Often think about, all the things that we have shared
The ups and downs

So thanks to all our friends,
Without you we'd be at home again
Goodbye its not the end,
Hope that we'll see you when we're here again

Goodbye to all our friends, goodbye
