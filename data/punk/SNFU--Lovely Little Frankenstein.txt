I wonder what Mon and Dad would say
I wouldn't want to bring them shame
I know one day I'll have to tell them
Oh yes I'll tell them about 'it'
My lovely little Frankenstein
A love like ours is hard to find
My lovely little Frankenstein
A love like ours is blind
It lives up on the darkened hill
Big city life would bring it death
A close personal friend of mine
My lovely little Frankenstein
It listens as I quietly talk
While hand in hand on our nightly walk
I get lost in it's eyes as it stares into mine
My lovely little Frankenstein
