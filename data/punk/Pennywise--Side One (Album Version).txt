when you're alone 
you're on your own 
this world is no place for the weak 
we've got to find ourselves in unity 
cause strength in numbers is what we seek 
togetherness friendship is best 
no one can stop us when we all work as one 
when problems come we've already won 
cause we know whose side we're on 
come together and fight together 
unite together as one 
come together and fight together 
fight forever till we have one camaraderie amity 
it's good to know whose side you're on 
conviviality homogeneity 
together we cant go wrong
