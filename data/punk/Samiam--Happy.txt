Look ahead, the lights are red, I know I should've called
And said I wouldn't be there at the time agreed upon
I thought that you would wait for me
I don't know why it's hard for me to be on time

Sitting at the table all alone
You look so pretty I can't believe it
You say that you are leaving
I thought you'd always be there
Much as I hate to see you go I'm happy for you
I won't know that I'm missing you
Until you're kissing someone new, that's how it goes

I'm moving forward standing still
Each day another page in my unwritten will
It's becoming clear to me
What everybody else could see all along
Sitting at the table all alone, you looked so pretty then
I thought that you would wait for me
I don't know why it's hard for me to be on time
