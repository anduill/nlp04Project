I am here but where is she ? We were supposed to meet at three.
Now I'm soaking wet from the pouring rain, it looks like I've been blown out again. 

Although I try it's all in vain, i've been blown out blown out again. 
It's not my fault I'm not to blame, i've been blown out blown out again. 

Been promised a lift from me mate, but he ain't arrived and it's getting late. 
But when he arrives the car is full, i've been blown out and I feel a fool. 

This curse upon me is a pain, i've been blown out blown out again. 
It's not my fault I'm not to blame, ive been blown out blown out again. 

I'm on the guest list for a gig in town, so I make a special effort of going down. 
But when I get there they can't find my name, it looks like I've been blown out again.
