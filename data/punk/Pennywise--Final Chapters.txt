Outside my window I see trouble. 
On the faces on the people in the streets below. 
One gets a feeling discontentment. 
Why there is anger I don't know. 
Or is it always in my mind. 
Or my vivid imagination.
Creating this monster at my side. 
Hello, hello to who's ever out there. 
Can you please give us some more time. 
Or is this the final chapter. 
Final chapter of the world.
So many times, so many chances. 
So many roadblocks I see on the way. 
I think a new start is in order. 
It's time to build a new highway.
Fight, fight, fight. 
The end result is that we'll all
Die, die, die. 
Generations will wonder
Why, why, why. 
Why we kissed our ass good
Bye, bye, bye. 
I'll see you on the other side.
Why there should be so many answers. 
I'll see you on the other side.
