Hands tied, eyes closed.
So many things I've had to say
So many chances have escaped.
Facing life with blinders on
A slave to my own inhibitions.
And at times there's peace
Moments of release
From the terror that petrifies life.
But it never lasts
The sky's are overcast.
The bravado is washed away.
Hands tied, eyes closed.
The things I've had to say
Chances I've let escape
Watch them slip away, watch them die out.
Always there
Hidden fear
Of self doubt
Cant break out.
I wont let it win
I cant let it win.
I wont let it win
I cant let it win.
Close my eyes and hope
Hope it goes away
Hope I'm safe inside for another day.
Close my eyes and hope
Hope it goes away
Hope I'm safe inside for another day.
