do you believe there's hope for your kind,
that your insatiable quest for direction will one day
help you find veracity and meaning to your existence as a whole,
that all your dreams of happy endings
will be achieved with faith and sometimes
do you feel that cold wind blowin you beyond all you think is right--
beyond all realm of human thought,
beyond your foolish thinking,
one step ahead is one inch closer to the end
