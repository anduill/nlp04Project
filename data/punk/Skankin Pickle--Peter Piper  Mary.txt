Peter Piper picked a peck of pickleed peppers.
Peter Piper picked em
But where did he put em
In the pockets of his pants 
Or on a plate
There's a pickle in his pocket
Ready to penetrate.
Mary had a little lamb
It's true
But she put it in the pot
And now its stew
Had no friends til Peter's phone rang
Now Peter's pickle's gonna get poon tang.
