Time - never bothered me
till I saw it slipping slowly away from me
And time took my years away
Give me back my memories of a better day

And now 
I've got a lot to lose
I've got a lot to learn
And no time to burn

Rain - spoiled a sunny day
Till I saw those cleansing drops took the dirt away
And change always frightened me
till I changed into the man I always knew I could be

And now 
I've got a lot to lose
I've got a lot to learn
And no time to burn

Here we go

Now 
I've got a lot to lose
I've got a lot to learn
And no time to burn

“After 20 year of riot and oppression
The quest for progress
And a lack of introspection
Have decimated this once proud country
And dragged it down
To its sorrowful state
Now there comes a time
In every mans life
When he must take a look at himself
Clean himself out
Less he be in danger, in danger…”

Now 
I've got a lot to lose
I've got a lot to learn
And no time to burn

Now 
I've got a lot to lose
A lot to learn
And no time to burn
