[Verse] 
I put some gas in my car and I'm ready to go go go. 
We'll blow this town for a while, doesn't matter where we go. 
You think we might get away with it, I think we might get away with it but how? 
Oh, I've got to know how.

[Bridge]
Monday morning they'll be asking questions, 
Monday morning we'll have to answer questions, 
so let's get our story straight, 
let's tie up all these loose ends.

[Chorus]
I'll give you an alibi, I, I'll give you an alibi, too. 
We'll live together forever in our own place. 
We'll live together like we always wanted to do.

[Verse]
Radio's playing and we all know the words to the song. 
There's a man in the trunk and I don't think he's singing along. 
You think. . .

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse]
I see the red lights on top of that black and white car. 
Don't look suspicious cause I think we've got'em fooled so far. 
You think. . .

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I put some gas in my car. [4x]
