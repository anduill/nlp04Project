Ice cold, Heart stone
You want fresh meat, But I won't eat it
You can't touch me, Your insides ugly
It's a slap in the face, But you gave it away
You give in to fame
Then, you found yourself high
And you're gonna feel low
And you find yourself colder than the winter
Can't bare to be alone
Faded man
Ice cold, Bare bones
You take flesh and you take asprin,
Glad I faked it, 'Cos now its ended
'Cos you found yourself high, Now you're going below
When your throat becomes dry, And you wanna go home
Faded man
But the airports are closed, And your credit card knows
Your honesty's left back on the runway
Screaming for the phone, It's the fading of a man
Like a slap in the face, But you gave it away
You gave in to fame
Then, you found yourself high
And you're gonna feel low
And you find yourself colder than the winter
Melting like the snow
Faded man
And you find yourself high, Now your going below
And your faces are changing like the seasons
Breaking like a bone
It's the fading of a man
