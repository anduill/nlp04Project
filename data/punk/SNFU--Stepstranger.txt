The TV's loud It screams at me again Reminds me of my mom Fighting with my new step dad
Who the hell are you? All you do is fuck my mom and eat her food Why should I listen to you? You are a stranger to me and you will always be
Paying the rent won't buy you ownership Stocking the fridge won't get you my respect Trust and friendship are something you should earn You sir, are nothing but a wiggly worm
Who the hell are you? All you do is fuck my mom and eat her food Why should I listen to you? You are a stranger to me and you will always be
Who the hell are you? All you do is fuck my mom and eat her food Why should I listen to you? You are a stranger to me and you will always be
