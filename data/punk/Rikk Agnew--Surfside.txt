Jowes after 999, turned frankenstein
And led the squad, black leather prod, in pillage and decline
The houses houses that were slain,
Attention we would gain,
The mindles fun had just begun,now done we will remain
The slashes have all healed, the history is sealed,
Inside our minds, its all behind the havoc we have wield

[Chorus]
Surfside days,
Destructive ways,
No longer do the flames burn
From the hell that we have raised

Surfside, surfside,
outside of slashers, non-facists,

[Repeat verse]

[Chorus]

Shoute during octaves at end:
Surfwood, Erin, Tricky D
Artificial Women, eggs body.

We'll be back
