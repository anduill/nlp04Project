They wanted us to go
To new york city
But the man at the embassy
Said "oh, what a pity!"
"we know all the things you've done in the past
But never mind son...carry on smokin' the grass"

They didn't want us in the usa
We didn't wanna go there anyway
They don't want us in the u s of a

Our manager said to us
"what's all the fuss?!"
We said we don't know
But they won't let us go
What could you do to make them do this to you
I don't know boss!
Have a little puff on the grass

They didn't want us in the usa
We didn't wanna go there anyway
They don't want us in the u s of a

The press all started to ring
Asking what's happening?
My boss said i don't know
But i said they won't let us go!
We don't care what you think of us
This is were we live!
"stick america up your ass!"

They didn't want us in the usa
We didn't wanna go there anyway
They don't want us in the u s of a
