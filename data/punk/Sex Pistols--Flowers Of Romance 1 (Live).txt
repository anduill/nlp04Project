 

Depending on the company
On the veranda talk of the future or reminisce
Behind the dialog, we're in a mess
Whatever I intended, I sent you flowers
You wanted chocolates instead

The flowers of romance
The flowers of romance

I've got binoculars on top of box hill
I could be Nero, fly the eagle, start all over again
I can't depend on these so-called friends
It's a pity you need to defend
I'll take the furniture, start all over again

Depending on the company
On the veranda talk of the future or reminisce
