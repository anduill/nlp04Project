Police, police
Don't worry, attack them on the street
Police, police
Don't ever surrender and fight against these shits
Police, police
None of them are innocent and they know it
But now the time has come
And someone must pay

Officers, officers
Steal to keep what we pay for
Officers, officers
We hate you damn thieves
Officers, officers
Kill them and be proud men
Because now the time has come
And someone must pay
