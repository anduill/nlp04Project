No Sleep `til Belfast
5 years on we`re still the same
Fucking useless with the same old name
Bored of this life and you are too
Thought that we'd try something new
Now we`ve decided to rap tonight
But all we came up with was this ol `shite
Inflammable material planted in my head
It`s a suspect device that's left 2000 dead

No Sleep `til Belfast
No sleep `til Belfast

See the boys drink boots of lager
Fuck the car, into the Lagan
See the hoodlums scream and rock
Act like you don`t give a fuck
Henry, Dolphin, Jake, Ali
All together we're SLF
Now you`re ready to feel the noise
Listen to the Stiff Little Beastie Boys

No Sleep `til Belfast
No Sleep `til Belfast
Alright Henry`s gonna wheel some hot guitar at ya
No Sleep `til Belfast 
No sleep `til Belfast
No Sleep `til Belfast
No Sleep `til the Ulster Hall
