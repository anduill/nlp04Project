No more smiles
It's just teardrops falling to the ground
No one's around
And I don't love you anymore
And I'm sore about it
When did my heart change its mind?
It must have been during the changing of times

[Chorus]
No more smiles from now on
They are all gone
I'll never understand what went wrong

[Repeat chorus]
No more lies
Now the hard part's over so they say
There's no way that I could take another day
Let's not talk about it
When did my love for you die?
Kiss me once and it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus x4]
