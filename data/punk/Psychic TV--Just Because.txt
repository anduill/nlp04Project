I like you
I like you
You're very nice
I like you
I like you
You're paradise
Oh you're very nice
Your eyes are ice
I think that I'm in paradise
But as I look into your face
I feel I may fall from grace
'Cos I like you

Now I'm back in the hall of your secret house with you
We just came back from the place "The View" (we two)
And I see all the things on the wall that you tried to hide from me
But baby it's just because I cared for you that I can see
All the ghost in the jackets tucked inside your closet
And the keys you think you hid inside your pocket
But i know who you are and I know what you want and I know why you love me
It's because I always say I don't care what you do or make anything of it (anyway)
So you may think I'm just there to help you and make you love me again
But I know you know that it's not true and I'm really a real friend 
Because

I like you
You're very nice
I like you
I like you
You're paradise
Oh you're very nice
Your eyes are ice
I think that I'm in paradise
But as I look into your eyes
I feel that I may realize
That i like you

Na na na na na na na na na na naaaah

Now we're in your kitchen and I see that you've cleaned up after me
And the window is open and I can see your only tree
In the garden you keep so clean and neat since I left you 

When we were young
Maybe it's because I suffered a collapsed lung
That I see the fridge is so empty now like your heart
That I used to love somehow
And the marble table with all the things on it
The plates and the cups and the knives and the forks
Your sonnet
Maybe when
we are back together we can try and talk
But I don't know if I could do this
Because I love you and yet
you won't even kiss....me
So i think I might just hide away and give up on bliss today
But I knwo it's not that easy 'cos it's so hard to be in love with you
Maybe now I can try to hide again upstairs with you
Because

I like you 
I like you
You're very nice
I like you
I like you
You're paradise
Oh you're very nice
Your eyes are ice
I think that I'm in paradise
But as I look into your face
I feel that I may fall from grace
'Cos I like you

Now we're in your bedroom and I'm feeling a little better 
I remember now what you said when you read my last letter
See you've still got that picture on the wall that you stole from
The hotel on the wall when we were together
It is just a cute dog or is it a mirror or something better
Should I let her say what she wants me to be
'Cos I really can't see 'cos I'm blind you know
And I really just want to lie right next to you
And try to be so special for you and say what I want ot do 
Press the pillows beneath your head
Make love and break the bed
But I can't 'cos I really don't know what I want
Though I know that I want you to love me anyway
Oh it's so hard these days
To try and tell you this way
That I've loved you every play
Every singl day I was your prey
Because

I like you 
I like you
You're very nice
I like you
I like you
You're paradise
Oh you're very nice
Your eyes are ice
I think that I'm in paradise
But as I look into your face
I feel that I may fall from grace
'Cos I like you
