Lust and flickering as the needle pierces trough
Flickering, twitching as the drug gets to you
Screaming, kicking as the pain emerges
Shattered and broken, such as deadly curse

In your hunt to find happiness and peace of mind
To get away from your mistakes, no matter what it takes

Waiting, hoping as I look down on you
Praying, crying that you will make it through
Fading and dying and don't know what to do
Hey man, I didn't even know you

Another one to die without a reason why
Why can't we ever learn? Soon it might be your turn
It's not easy just to quit, we all got to be a part of it
Something's gotta change fast or we will not last
