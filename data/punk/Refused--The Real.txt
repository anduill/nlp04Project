The real revolution starts within
The real revolution starts within

Locked down and caged our lives directed
We just can't ignore the real reasons
We are just as much to blame as anyone else
Silent in apathy we won't make a difference

How can we say
That we are not a part of the problem
We are not a part of the problem
That's not true

How can we say
That we are not a part of the problem
We are not a part of the problem

Stereotype values and intoxication
Won't bring about change
There's a reason for the rejection
I feel it in my range

A protest to insufficiency
A purpose to save and heal
A balance to recover
The distorded picture

How can we say
That we are not a part of the problem
We are not a part of the problem
That's not true

How can we say
That we are not a part of the problem
We are not a part of the problem

Words mean nothing
Action is what counts
And when it comes down to it
Don't count me out

Words mean nothing
Action is what counts
And when it comes down to action
Don't count me out
