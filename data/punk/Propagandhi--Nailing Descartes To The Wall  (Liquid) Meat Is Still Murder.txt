Stop consuming animals. 
I speak outside what is recognized as the border between reason and insanity, 
but I consider it a measure of my humanity to be written off 
by the living graves of a billion murdered lives. 
And I'm not ashamed of my recurring dreams about me and a gun and a different species 
of carnage strewn about the stockyards, the factories and farms. 
Still, I know as well as anyone, it does less good than harm 
to be honest with a conscience eased by lies. 
But you cannot deny that meat is still murder, dairy is still rape. 
And I am still as stupid as anyone, but I know my mistakes. 
And I have recognized one form of oppression; now I recognize the rest. 
Life's too short to make others' shorter.
