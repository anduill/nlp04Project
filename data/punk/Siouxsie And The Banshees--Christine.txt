She tries not to shatter, kaleidoscope style Personality changes behind her red smile Every new problem brings a stranger inside Heplessly forcing one more new disguise
Christine, the strawberry girl Christine, banana split lady Christine, the strawberry girl Christine, banana split lady
Singing sweet savages lost in our world This big eyed girl sees her faces unfurl Now's shes in purple now's shes the turtle Distintegrating
Christine, the strawberry girl Christine, banana split lady Christine, the strawberry girl Christine sees her faces unfurl
Now's shes in purple Now's she the turtle Disintegrating Christine, Christine
Christine, the strawberry girl Christine, banana split lady Christine, the strawberry girl Christine sees her faces unfurl
Christine, Christine, Christine Christine turn into faces Disintegrating Christine, Christine Disintegrating
