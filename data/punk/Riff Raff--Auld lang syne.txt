Should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind,
should all acquaintance be forgot and the days of auld lang syne.


For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne,
we'll take a cup of kindness yet for the sake of auld lang syne.


Let's have a drink or maybe two or maybe three or four
or five or six or seven or eight or maybe even more.


For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne,
we'll take a cup of kindness yet for the sake of auld lang syne.


When it gets to closing time and if you still want more,
I know a pub in Inverness that never shuts its door.


For auld lang syne, my dear, for auld lang syne,
we'll take a cup of kindness yet for the sake of auld lang syne.
