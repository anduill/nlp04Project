You Sit Down In The Bus Shelter
It's Raining Like Times Before
The Bus Is Late As Usual
And Your Dinner Cold Once More
You Put Your Pay On The Table
And Your Old Man Does The Same
Then Your Mum Slip's You A Tenner
Have A Drink Don't Feel Ashamed

So Be Free And Easy
And Hold You Head Up High
Sing Out An Anthem For Kids 
Bring A Tear Out To Your Eye

Last Orders I Hear The Bell Ring
Outside It's Still Raining Again
We Go Down To The Snack Bar
Fish And Chip's We Do Refrain
Mum And Dad's Sat On The Sofa
I See Love There Holding Hands
She Kisses Me Goodnight Son
I'm Proud To Live In This Land

So Be Free And Easy
And Hold You Head Up High
Sing Out An Anthem For Kids 
Bring A Tear Out To Your Eye

So Be Free And Easy
And Hold You Head Up High (Repeat Till End)
