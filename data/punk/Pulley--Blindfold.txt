Sitting in the backyard on a Sunday in the morning
Touched by you and all your curls that sucked me in
I can hear you when you're screaming
I hear you when you're talking to me
Laughing at the jokes, laughing at the jokes
I've said before it's only over when you've given up on me
You held it in for so long detaching yourself from everything I gave
Now you're on your own there's nobody else
So happy on the outside with your conscience coming home
Blindfold me a role, blindfold me a role you play so well
There's one thing left to say
Those words I said to you were never true
Justified everything I gave to you
I won't ever look at you the same
Step aside you always walk away
