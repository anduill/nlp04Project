please don't be the sensitive one cause negative thruts are too damn funny don't frak out the words from my mouth are against everybody no one is singled out nobody's protected - nobody's safe
what stereotype ist that how can you help but laugh who's feelings are hurt again this one with the thin skin who should learn to laugh at himself at himself
evil for yuks is never malicious just some bunk to raise the spirits every group and orientation is fair game for me to rip on thin skin - stay away nobody is safe
what stereotype ist that how can you help but laugh who's feelings are hurt again this one with the thin skin who should learn to laugh at himself and everybody else
evil for yuks thin skin - you suck evil for yuks thin skin - you suck
