I was at the lowest point of my life
I couldn't talk to anyone
Truly alone
There's no telling what I might have done
If it hadn't been for you
You pulled me through

[Chorus]
I don't know if you actually saved my life
But you changed it that's for sure, yeah
You spoke to me, yeah
You spoke to me, yeah

I drove all the way from Carpentersville
To see you here tonight
And it was worth it
You didn't play my favorite song
But that's all right
I love the new stuff too
I'm just glad I got to see you

[Chorus twice]
