When you're young you stand your ground
And nothing seem to get you down at all
Then you grow to realise
That everything ain't black and white, it's brown
On and on your life drags on and every day's the same

(Chorus:)
It's a long way to paradise from here
It's a long way to paradise from here

Every week you stand in line
You queue to put your name upon a form
And every week they have devised
Another way of making you feel small
On and on your life grinds on and you're not living at all

(Chorus)

You think you're tough, You think you're smart
But they know how to break your heart
they'll chew you up and spit you out and make you start again

(Chorus)
