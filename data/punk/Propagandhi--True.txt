When I've had enough, I'll get a pick-up truck and drive away
I'll take my last 10 bucks just as far as it will go
Yeah, sometimes I'm easily fooled
I take a painful step and get knocked back two

I do all I can and it's all I can do, true

And if I had the choice, I'd take the voice I got
'Cause it was hard to find, y'know, I've come too far to wind up
Right back where I started, they tell me who I should be
But I'll never let you flickers make a mess of me

I do all I can and it's all I can do, true
One more sunset, lay my head down, true
One more sunrise, open my eyes, true

They'll talk you up, they'll talk you down, begin to doubt
Your reasons seem very far away, yeah
And I'll stop breathing the day
That I can't walk proud, rather walk away

I do all I can and it's all I can do
I do all I can and i do it for you, true
