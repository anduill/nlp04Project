Suburban kid, ya got no name
Two ton(e) baby and ya got no brain
I bet you're only happy in suburbian dreams
But I'm only laughing cause you ain't in my scheme

Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you

I only ever listen when you're on the phone
From your safety where you sit at home
When I got nothin' better to do
Then there is always you
Cause you're good for my shoe

Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you

I'm in love
Yeah in love
Oh, can't you feel it?

No I don't like where you come from
It's just a satellite of London
And when you look me in the eye
Just remember that I wanna die

Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you

You're the name but you can't tell
Lookin' like you just came outta hell
How did ya figure that'd you'd any use?
All you're gonna get is my abuse

Hey baby
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
