Gonna have a better day
Than I did yesterday
I can tell you now nothing else
Is gonna get in my way

I've gotta live for today
Cos I was bored by yesterday

I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
On a production line
Cause I've never seen a bigger waste
Of anybody's time

Give me playing in a band
And put a beer into my hand

And we will steal your thunder
Yes we will steal your thunder
Yes we will steal your thunder, tonight

When you get bored of all those records
That sit on your shelf
Take a walk down to your music shop
And spread some of your wealth

Because music is the key
To keeping yourself happy

When it all goes exactly wrong
And everybody hates you
Don't give up your gun
As if there's nothing else you can do

You gotta live for today
Cause you were bored by yesterday

And we will steal your thunder
Yes we will steal your thunder
Yes we will steal your thunder, tonight
