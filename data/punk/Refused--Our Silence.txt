hut your mouth, this is the age of freedom Gagged masses, who are the ones that lead us? Disregarded system and it's set up by who? Uses so many, but it benefits so few
With our silence, we vote for continuation With our silence, we bow down to oppression We try to deny that we still have a choice But I will bite the hand that tries to feed us
Promises of salvation, golden dreams to assure apathy With our silence, we vote for continuation With our silence, we bow down to oppression
But will we remain content? Will we remain silent and happy? We will remain silent, they will remain happy
