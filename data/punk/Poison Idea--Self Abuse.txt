Take frustrations out on yourself,
Think you've hurt all, there's no one else,
Put your head thru a window,
Then hold it high and let the blood flow,
Why do you drink untill you pass out face first in front of me?
Then crawl up and bleed all over my new shirt,
Self Abuse,
In a cold dark alley, the figure stands,
Abuseing himself, dripping in his hands,
He say's he's punishing his peers around him,
Watch this never was, turn has been,
I hope someday you find your place,
With cigarette burns on your face,
If you want attention, don't act insane,
Cause you're addicted to the pain,
Rip the stitches out with your teeth,
And you have the nerve to judge others?
Self abuse.
