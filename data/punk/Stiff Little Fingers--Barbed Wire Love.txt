I met you in No Man's Land
Across the wire we were holding hands
Hearts a-bubble in the rubble
It was love at bomb site

(Chorus)
All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans

When I fell it was awful nice
Caught when not suspect vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

(Chorus)

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee caps
Your eyes did shine
Your lips were fine
And the device in your pants was out of sight

(Chorus)
