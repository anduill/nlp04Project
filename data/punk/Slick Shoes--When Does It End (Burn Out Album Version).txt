Taking my time,
I thought I had learned how to deal with all the changes in my life.
Things were going the way I had planned,
one more thing was thrown at me.
When does this heartache and pain ever end?
As long as I not by myself I know Il be o.k.
It seems like every time things were going o.k.,
life throws me a curve.
I stop for a second and ask myself,
am I ever gonna make it through?
