Wake up with the feeling that the whole world got you down 
Pressure that keeps building got you dragging on the ground 
Chaos keeps on losing in no answers to be found 
For what you are feeling now 
Danger that surrounds you it gets worse here everyday

Criminals in power want to take your rights away 
Never hear your protest they won't have you have your say 
Can't find a better way but you don't try just 
Sit there and whine about your decline 
I think it's pathetic sort of life you choose 
Methods abused solutions refused 
Well good for you but some day you will loose your life 
Without even giving it a try 
Depression's the only thing you'll find 
Give it one chance before you die 
Just got one day to get a life 
Everyday procrastinate you won't get very far 
Listen to religion try and tell you who you are 
Marionettes on TV sets parade across your screen 
But you don't know what it all means 
Think there is no point in trying to get up each day 
When problems that confound only speed your slow decay 
Future's relegated to a bland pathetic waste 
Cause you can't find a better way 
Know you'll never make it you don't even want to try 
Waiting for the day when you can curl up and die 
Tell anyone who'll listen the world's out to get you 
Blame anyone you want you get the life you choose 
So when you gone get a clue 
No one's gone wait for you 
Only you can make it all come true 
A never-ending struggle but one day you'll see the light 
May not think you'll make it don't give up without a fight 
Stay fast to aspirations of what you think is right and 
Fight on with all your might
