Can somebody tell me why
truth is such a fuckin' lie
close my heart and turn it out
I'm disgusted
so far gone and out of reach
they kick you in the fuckin' teeth
all I wanna know is why
you're all busted

You can't pressure me
when will you see the walls that are closing in
you wanna take, take, take 'till you have it allv Can't trust it
your busted ass
Can't trust it
who's the one to suffer now
you're the one who showed me how
put yourself on the ropes
There's no brea
