Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered in oil
Strummin' my six string, on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimps they're beginning to boil

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know, it's nobody's fault

I don't know the reason I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

I blew out my flip flop stepped on a pop top
Cut my hell had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender and soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wasted away again in Margaritaville
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
And I know, it's my own damned fault
