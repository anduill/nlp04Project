rching through the mud, dying in the blood
Where's the honor in your death?
God Queen and country your last breath?
Last thing you're gonna see what it's gonna be 
Your friends or family by your side 
Or mortar flash and genocide?

Fight

Pushed around at school, made to look a fool
Hold Mommy's hand and start to cry
Wishing everyone would die
Someone's hitting your girl
Messing with your world
Don't let them get away with that
Stand and fight, don't turn your back

Fight

Know your own mind, I look after me and mine
No point in going off to war if nothing's worth fighting
For no need to die tonight, make sure the fight is right
Heroes lie everywhere when you're dead and gone, no one cares

Fight
