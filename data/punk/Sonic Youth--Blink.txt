I can see
My body move
It goes without me
What I used to be
Prove it
A breath for you
No kiss
My tears they fly
In the wind
I blink you die
Cuz you believe
In what I can see
My body moves
It goes without me
It used to dance one two one two
It used to prance one two one two
Now I follow you
Forever
You compell me to
Fly.... flew..
I blink and see
Nothing
Forever
One two one two
I ache for you
My soul has got a hole
To see you through
