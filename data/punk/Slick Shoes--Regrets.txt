As I stand here and wait for you, you don't know How I feel, guess I'm too shy to let you know My heart's in control, this time I know, everything will be okay
I don't know what you would think I don't know what to expect
No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up, I don't want to end with regrets
I can't stop thinking of you Can't get you out of my thoughts Can't concentrate, I'm losing my head over a girl
I know I'll always love you I wish that you felt the same
No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up, I don't want to end with regrets
I don't know what you would think I don't know what to expect
No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up No matter what happens, you will be my friend I'm not going to mess this up, I don't want to end with regrets
