They never ask us if we want a war Who do they think they're talkin' for 'Cos we never get no say They have to have it all their way
Oh, we want no more of that You can't push us under the mat Oh we want no more of that
The man who pulls the trigger's not to blame He's only playing their deadly game And he knows he just can't win Or someone else will pull the trigger on him
