I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove
But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck
Because you always told me that when we were together
You were happy for the very first time,
I'd look into your blue eyes and figured that you meant it
And that everybody else was lying
But now you come and tell me that you really like me
And you hope that we can still be friends,
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck
Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same

And it's true, you cheapend yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again
Now I know, you never really loved me anyway
But who cares, I learned from you just the same
And it's true, you cheapend yourself to better me
Cause I'm sure, I'll never fall for your kind again
I never ever wanted to get too close to you
I didn't wanna fall in love
They'd tell me all the stories of the boys and their glory
Nearly died when you gave them the shove
But I fell for you honey, now I'm feeling funny
Like maybe I'm the next in line
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess I'm just another guy out of luck, whoa-whoa
I guess this time I've just run out of luck
