It was just another night in good old London Town
She was not from the city but it never got her down
Hate was not in her vocabulary
But she became a victim of her own naivety

Feeling high after a night in London Town
Unaware that somebody was hanging around
Who was that she could see
A face with no personality

No way out, no turning back
Her fate in the hands of a maniac
Nowhere to flee, nowhere to hide
It happened so fast and now she's got no pride

Who would wan't a night in good old London Town
Stay out of the city, 'cos fun can still be found
You ain't safe, listen to me
You ain't safe in this society
