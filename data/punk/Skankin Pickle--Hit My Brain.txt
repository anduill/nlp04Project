I FEEL GOOD!

I feel good, oh yeah!
Yeah, I feel good, I do, I do, I do, it's true!

I feel good,
Nothing you can do about that
I feel good,
Trimmed too thin, I cut the fat
I feel good,
Like James Brown before me
I feel good,
That's just the way it's supposed to be

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

I feel good, oh yeah!
I feel good, I do, I do, how about you?

I feel good,
Dr. J has medicated
I feel good,
Relaxed and rejuvenated
I feel good,
No L Ron Hubbard set me free
I feel good,
Won't hear me cry like Morrissey

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

Yeah, I feel good, oh yeah!
Yeah, I feel good, I do, I do, I do, it's true!

I feel good,
Lars and Gerry on trombone
I feel good,
Michael plays the saxophone
I feel good,
Lynette's guitar is my friend
I feel good,
And Chucky Phelps, he plays the skins

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

I once thought that I was through
Being happy, I was so blue
Suddenly I felt no pain
Skankin' Pickle hit my brain

Yeah.
