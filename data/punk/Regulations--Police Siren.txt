The police patrols are out tonight 
looking for trouble looking for a fight 
i hear the sound of sirens 
its the sound of violence 

when you hear the sound of police sirens 
you better what your back 

a parade of pigs with hateful eyes 
out to protect dont believe their lies 
i hate the sound of sirens 
its the sound of violence 

when you hear the sound of police sirens 
you better watch your back 

i hear the sound of sirens 
its the sound of violence 
i hate the sound of sirens 
its the sound of violence
