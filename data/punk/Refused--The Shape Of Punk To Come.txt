Hey baby! you never felt this good
Freedom through your stereo and you wish you could
Take a bite, do a dance, get lost on a crusade, jump on this soul train: destination unknown
Yeah! Yeah! Arrrh!

We're all dressed up, we've got somewhere to go
All dressed up with somewhere to go
I told you so! I told you so!

We're all dressed up, we've got somewhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so! I told you so! I told you so!

Hey baby! never felt this free
A pair of new shoes & a punk rock show to see
Give acclamation to these blue ribbon babies, check the calendar for the expiration date

We've all been bitten
We've all been underground
We've all been beaten, battered, bruised, told to get down

We've all been bitten
We've all been shot down
We've all been beaten, battered, bruised, told to get down

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

We're all dressed up, we've got somewhere to go
All dressed up with somewhere to go
I told you so! I told you so!

We're all dressed up, we've got somewhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so! I told you so! I told you so!

Adolescent beats with a new thing to see
Smashed guitars just like you've seen on T.V.
With burning speakers & flaming hair
We'll have a riot right here

We'll have a riot right here
