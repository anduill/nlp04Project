Scrap the extras - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Cut out the spareparts - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Keep our eyes wide open

Fuck the idol - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Reject the star - Star, star, star
Let's feed ourselves some - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Destruction

Convention blackmails - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Creativity - Yeah! Yeah!
This lack of challange - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Kills me, kills me, kills me, kills me

Scrap the extras - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Cut out the spareparts
Fuck the idol, idol - Let's keep our eyes wide open
Reject the star

The rhymes of revolution
Poetry written in gasoline
The rhymes of revolution
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Manipulate the obvious
Cowards bought by traditionalist manners
Scream at the herd that are heard the most
Without substance and with useless... banners
Banners, banners, banners

Your art, your art, is worth, is worth nothing
Like a city with no meaning
Like a city, with no meaning, with no meaning
Your creation holds, holds no hope

The rhymes of revolution
Yeah! Yeah!
The rhymes of revolution
Poetry written in gasoline
Poetry written in gasoline
Poetry written in gasoline
Ah! Yeah!
You had a witness over there
