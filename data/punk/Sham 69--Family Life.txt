Does she always shout at you Does she tell you what to do I can get by I can get by Do you always stay out late Does she say you look a state I can get by I can get by
Cos it's better than getting chucked out Cos it's better than being alone Cos it's better than growing up fed up
Does she tell you not to swear How to comb your hair I can get by I can get by Is your sister on the pill How does your mum feel I can get by I can get by
Cos it's better than getting chucked out Cos it's better than being alone Cos it's better than growing up fed up
Does your brother wear your clothes Is he always up your nose I can get by I can get by
Cos it's better than getting chucked out Cos it's better than being alone Cos it's better than growing up fed up
