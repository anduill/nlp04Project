Pass me the bottle for one last drink
Cos the whole human race is teetering on the brink
We're gonna do it if it takes a million years
One last drink let's drown our fears

They just thought of a bomb that only kills
People on the dole without the fancy thrills
It's no good hiding in a fancy shelter
Cos they're all fitted with a dole card detector

And it's ohh ohh ohh ohh
They mean us this time, we've got nowhere to go
It's ohh ohh ohh ohh
So this is what they mean by dead end dole

What can we do?
Protest and survive, I don't think they're listening
I don't think they'll even try
