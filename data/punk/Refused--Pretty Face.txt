I try to write every line with perfection 
scarred to constant remember the violence - the wounds that you put me through 
I never meant the pain to you 
weak one shall continue as weak one 
and then it hurts it won&acute;t be the last one 
clouded thoughts makes it hard to fly - your pornographic dream is a lie 
this pretty face 
suppose I could oppose the role that you set for me 
the object you tried to make of me 
but this time I will just close my eyes - bite my lip and and try not to cry 
point that gun at your own head - kill this male ego dead 
constantly fuel - constantly fed - watch beautiful skin turn red 
your constant date rapes - your constant drive to destroy 
this pretty face
