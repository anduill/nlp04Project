Gone again she said 
heading for the longest road 
One too many times 
He's beaten you down to the bone 

So you sail away 
into the unknown 
Stay away he said 
Don't ever come back home 
Cry away
the days that last so long 
All alone
Just stay away 
Stay away 

Weakened from the pain 
that he left inside your heart 
Fallin' in the rain 
cause your whole life has fall'n apart 

So you sail away 
into the unknown 
Stay away he said 
Don't ever come back home 
Cry away
the days that last so long 
All alone
Just stay away 

Alone, she cries
Filled with hate inside
No love, no life
Without that loser who once said 
"Here's your kiss goodbye"

See this is real 
She doesn't feel 
Lonely hearts 
Shattered dreams 
There's nothing better in this place 
Nothing but memories
in your mind 

Sail away 
into the unknown 
Stay away he said 
Don't ever come back home 
Cry away
the days that last so long 
On the road
you sail away 

Alone, she cries
Filled with hate inside
No love, no life
Without that loser who once said 
"Here's your kiss goodbye"

Alone, she cries
Filled with hate inside
No love, no life
Without that loser who once said 
"Here's your kiss goodbye"
