You once tore me down when i was one the few.
Always on my back because i had a differnet view,
set to kill you'd cross my paht with damaging intentions,
but now you try to look like me and follow my directions.

You used to smile and now you dont.
You wanna be but now I wont accept you,
I reject you
You once tore me down saying I was trash,
but now it doesnt matter I just want your cast to spend.
I win in the end. 

I was once the butt of all your jokes, a worthless scum,
you never stoppped to really see where i was coming from.
Set to kill, against my berween you i was tossed.
And now you're my reflection, but the attitude is lost.

You used to smile and but you dont.
You wanna be but now I wont accept you,
I reject you
Dont you know i just want to use you par for my show, take you home
and seduce you
and reduce
Under the size
Telling you lies
Coz now I've got the power, and you a cheap disguise.

Your too late, too late, you dont belong.
