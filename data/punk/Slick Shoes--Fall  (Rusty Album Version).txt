Lord, I'm distracted By so many things of the world My eyes always stray from you But you are always watching over me
I don't know how you could stand Having me as your son I'm always so selfish And you are always so kind
Lord, you're always there for me Without you, I don't know what I would do You're always there for me Without you, I don't know what I would do
When everything is going well I rarely stop and thank you But, when nothing is going right I stop and complain to you
I don't know how you could stand Having me as your son I'm always so selfish And you are always so kind
Lord, you're always there for me Without you, I don't know what I would do You're always there for me Without you, I don't know what I would do
Don't let me, don't let me fall Don't let me fall, don't let me fall Don't let me fall
