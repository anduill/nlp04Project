You pull me by the arm 
Tell me what to believe 
You tell me there is only one way 
One way to see 
Whatever faith you choose 
May not be for me 
How can I be saved 
While being forced to believe 
Believe. 

Lets save the world 
One by one 
Well make them believe 
Conform if they must 
Dont question the thought 
Its whats always been told 
Well make them believe 
Lets save the world 

So spread the word 
And tell me of good news 
That if I act right 
I can be like you 
Well to live is to learn 
And think for yourself 
And ill do just that 
I dont need your help 

[Repeat]
