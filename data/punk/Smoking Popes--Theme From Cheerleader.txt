Proud to wear the uniform
Of a man who won't conform
Learning how to fit the mold
Of a man who can't be told

Climb aboard that tour bus
Down the road less traveled
Every song sounds like the last one
Let's make this next one a fast one

I don't think the way to see something
Is to stand behind somebody else
I don't think the way to say something
Is to be a cheerleader
