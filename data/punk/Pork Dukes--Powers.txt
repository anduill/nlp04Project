She's 84 - She can't work no more 
Her hands get sore when she does the chores. 
She earned a million pounds - for another man 
Who drives a car, who knows the law, but he tries to ignore! 

Powers - we don't use it 
Powers - we don't know 
Powers - we don't chose it 
Powers - we don't know 

Boy with a gun - told where to run 
He's got to blacken his face - just to hide his disgrace. 
He knows no fear - but when the people jeer 
And the women snear - cuz they read the news 

Powers - we don't use it 
Powers - we don't know (We got) 
Powers - we don't chose it 
Powers - we don't know 

Man with a flag - around his neck 
He says you can make love - but you better be in bed 
He says you can make love - but with your own kind 
If you must kill a man then hold on I'll just close my eyes. 

Powers - we don't use it 
Powers - we don't know (We got) 
Powers - we don't chose it 
Powers - we don't know
