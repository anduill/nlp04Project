Uurh, uurh, uurh

I am a dog outside your door
I have been there since quarter to four
You are a cat lickin' intense
I bite your leg in self-defense

Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh

Get out my tree, grinnin' at me
Lickin' your tail like it's cream
Strokin' your whiskers, causin' a scene
That's not the way to be to me
(That's not the way)

Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh

And the doggy say to the kitty
La, la, la, he, he, hee
I want you, you want me
Oh, how sexy it will be
Ever get together in my tree

Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh

Hey, little pussy you sure look sweet
Knockin' me off of my four feet
(Knockin' me off of my four feet)
Sure do wish dogs could climb
(I wish, I wish)
Then we could have a funky good time

Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh
Say it again, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh

Why you wink at me?
I don't wanna see
(I don't wanna see)
Nasty little cat up a forbidden tree
Is it really wortha one night of fun?
You've got nine lives, I only got one

Say it, uurh, uurh, uurh, uurh

And the doggy say to the kitty
La la la, he he hee
I want you, you want me
Oh, how sexy it will be
If we ever get together in my tree

I'm pickin' up your scent
