She's always restless, she's over-medicated With the kind of emotion that feels out of place Never give your opinion, they've got all the answers Follow the leader but remember where you've been
So don't leave, it's not me you know Can't control what goes through my mind So stay, please understand, I don't mean all I said tonight
Haven't slept for days and my words Don't seem to come out right It's just a phase that you're gonna grow out of When you die and it's alright You know, everything's going to be just fine Is it too much to ask for, some kind of ordinary life?
Two weeks, clean a vague reality From a life time clouded, lost details of your dreams The words you eat, the pills you need to sleep Are things you never think if till they're always on your mind
So don't leave, it's not me you know Can't control what goes through my mind So stay, please understand, I don't mean all I said tonight
Haven't slept for days and my words Don't seem to come out right It's just a phase that you're gonna grow out of When you die and it's alright You know everything's going to be just fine Is it too much to ask for some kind of ordinary life?
Don't leave, it's not me you know Can't control what goes through my mind So stay please understand, I don't mean all I said tonight.
Haven't slept for days and my words Don't seem to come out right It's just a phase that you're gonna grow out of When you die and its alright
You know everything's going to be just fine Is it too much to ask for some kind of ordinary life? Is it too much to ask for, some kind of ordinary life?
