I've been living in hell 
Now it's in my brain 
I'm a ticking bomb 
Ready to explode 

I got my life 
I got my problems 
I got my life 
My problems 

I can hear what you say 
But it makes no sense 
I know what you mean 
But I don't care I don't give a fuck 

I got my life 
I got my problems 
I got my life 
My problems 

Problems in my past 
Trouble in the future 
So give me a break 
Or I'll smash my 

I got my life 
I got my problems 
I got my life 
My problems
