Remember those days when you were at school
Long summer days nights by the pool, yeah
Doing things you'd never dare
Didn't seem to matter didn't even care

And you knew that no one could fool ya
It didn't mean nothing to ya
Remember those days of long ago
You'd go out to all night show

Wo oh - how come everybody sees it but me
Wo oh - how come that the jokes on me

Remember those days we all grew up now
Things never seemed the way they used
When you're a boy of 9 or 10
Things just seemed so different then
Well everyone changes throughout their lives
Work in an office or be a wife
So wealthy men in satin shoes
Take your chances it's win or lose
