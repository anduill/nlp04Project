Some unions are based on trust, some unions are a must Trussed up like a turkey, upside down on a turn key You and me
Some like it on the other side Others like to play both sides
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big girls I give I give I give I give I give I give, big joys
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big toys I give I give I give I give I give I give, I give I give
I'll give you gristle, you blow the whistle Waiter service, wait for this miss And don't you diss this, this is bliss miss Around the world with this miss
Disgusting lewd rudeness Secretly seductive, spontaneous combustive Happiness a penis, I give I give I give I give, give, give, give, give, give
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big girls I give I give I give I give I give I give, big joys
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big toys I give I give I give I give I give I give, I give I give
You can wear high heals in unusual places And different situations can fit into new faces
Somebody's like to roll in a sleaze Never mind me, just do as you please
All these implications All these connotations The pleasure in the leisure Without the complications
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big girls I give I give I give I give I give I give, I give I give
I give I give I give I give I give I give, big joys I give I give I give I give I give I give, I give I give I give I give I give I give
Big joys, big joys Big girls, big joys, big toys Big girls, big joys
