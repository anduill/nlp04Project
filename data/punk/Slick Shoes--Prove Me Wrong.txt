A softer kind of smile A star that holds your stare Everything I've ever known Just blew up in the air
Don't you hate it When every love song makes sense to you? And time away breaks your heart in two I really hate it now
They should have taught us this in school I really thought I was so cool You proved me wrong again You proved me wrong again
I can't wait 'til the next time I see you I can't wait 'til the next time I see you
It's getting hard to sleep at night I'll pretend that it's alright It doesn't feel that way
By now you probably hate this song It's probably best that it's not long I guess you proved me wrong I guess you proved me wrong
I can't wait 'til the next time I see you I can't wait 'til the next time I see you
I can't wait 'til the next time I see you I can't wait 'til the next time I see you
