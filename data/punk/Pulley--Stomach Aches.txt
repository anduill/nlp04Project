I guess I’ll let you know just how the story goes
Give you everything you want to hear
Tell me something I already know
It’s been long and hard 
Weary from the road been traveled
Can I walk away with you?
I don’t know why everything is always black and white
I don’t know if anything will every get it right
Words that fill the space when I say how I feel
Tell me something I already know
This feeling comes again my stomach aches with pain
Somewhere in the dark I lay
This trip is long and overdue for me
All the years they pass 
Stories grow to disbelief
Which one of you should I believe?
Alone I write 
Alone I dwell
Alone I rot trapped in this shell
Too old to be young but I’m not old
Loneliness I hear its call
Run behind but I still fall
Never happy
Sometimes I think I’m in hell
Going down this road again
