Write in passing when there's time Hide the paper, hide my mind Keep you quiet, keep you blind Don't rock the boat, don't read the sign
You're my co-pilot Not my God pilot
You take everything You take what I want You take everything You take what I want
Want from you is so defined Your suit and tie, your shiny smile Your calm belief, your piece of mind I'll trade you for it, then run, then fly
You're my co-pilot Not my God pilot
You take everything You take what I want You take everything You take what I want
You take what I want You take what I want You take what I want
