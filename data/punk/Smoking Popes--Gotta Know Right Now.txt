If I told you that I really Really liked you a lot I've wanted to for a long Long time but I never had the guts
I wonder what you would say I just can't go on this way I gotta know right now, today
I call your name from the Window of my car as I drive I wanna do something half insane To prove to you that I'm alive
I wonder what you would say I just can't go on this way I gotta know right now, today
As I walk by your house For the third time tonight And I stand in your drive way Hypnotized by your bedroom light
I wonder what you would say I just can't go on this way I gotta know right now, today
I gotta know right now I gotta know right now I gotta know right now
