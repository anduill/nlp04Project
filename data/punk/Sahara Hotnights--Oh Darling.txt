By now I know you have fooled me
Do you know I feel fooled?
How could I let you rule me
and why did I trust in beady eyes
I held you close

breakin' loose is not a problem for you
I was the fly in your fist
But you would set free in daylight
And I take off with small thin broke legs
I held you close

[Chorus:]
Oh sweet darling
You can buy my kisses
and sell them again
Oh my darling
Oh, you can steal feelings
and then throw them away

And you should quit playing dirty games
it's not fair, you win 'cause you cheat
and you know it
I had thought I had control
I seem to misjudge
maybe every situation
I held you close

[Chorus]

And who are you to decide
When I am supposed to smile
And you try, you try so hard
you try so hard, you try a lot
but you're a boy in a man
you're such an act, hard to get
when you're not, when you don't wanne be it
and I wish my wish was your command
I wish my wish was your command
