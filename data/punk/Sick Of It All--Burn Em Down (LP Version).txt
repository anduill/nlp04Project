At a crossroads in your life At a point to make a decision Do you play the game for monetary gain Or do you follow a code of ethics having to deal with some?
With the charm of a snake that speaks with a forked tongue They'll keep a casual bond to use you later on Disconnect yourself and get away Burn your bridges and don't look back
Burn 'em down, burn 'em down, burn 'em down Gotta burn it
They don't know what it means 'Cause all they understand is their greed They'll never know rewards of the soul And something to set yourself free
Think of moral wealth You're the one who's got to live with yourself You can't hide from the ties that bind You've got to burn those bridges and break those ties Burn those bridges and break those ties
Burn 'em down, burn 'em down, burn 'em down You're the one who's got to live with yourself You've got to
Burn 'em down, burn 'em down, burn 'em down Gotta burn it
The problem will arise, you've got to look deep down inside You're the one's who's got to live with yourself So can you smile for a price? Will you stay with those who will only? Drag you down, or do you cut the ties?
Stand up for yourself and hold your moral ground Do you stand with those who will only rip you off? Or do you strike the match and don't look back? And let 'em burn, let 'em burn, burn 'em down?
Burn 'em down, burn 'em down You're the one who's got to live with yourself You've got to
Burn 'em down, burn 'em down, burn 'em down Gotta burn it
