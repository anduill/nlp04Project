Snare drum pounds on the 2 and 4
All the party people get on the floor
All the party people get on the floor
Bass

Glam slam
Escape
Glam slam
Free your mind from this rat race
Glam slam
Escape

Fifteen minutes ain't long enough
To be out your mind in a world so tough
If you wanna escape and truly be
All the crack in Compton won't set you free
Come on

Glam slam
Free your mind from this rat race
Glam slam
Escape

You got to be yourself, you gotta be aware
'Cuz the gangster man, he don't give a care
Whether you live, or whether you die
Glam slam escape, gotta give it a try

Glam slam
Free your mind from this rat race
Glam slam
Escape

Party baby, party baby
Party baby, party baby
Party baby, party baby
Party baby, party baby

Glam slam
Escape

Everybody trippin' on the party bass
However high you get is a matter of taste
Winner takes all in the hardest race

Don't get on the scale if you ain't got the weight
It's more hard to love than it is to hate
Say, it's more hard to love than it is to hate
Come on, it's more hard to love than it is to hate
Yeah, it's more hard to love than it is to hate
One more, it's more hard to love than it is to hate

Escape
Glam slam
Glam slam
Free your mind from this rat race
Glam slam
Escape
