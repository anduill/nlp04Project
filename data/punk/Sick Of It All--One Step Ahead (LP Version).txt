It's right you know it, can't you see You're just fooling yourself? It's here, reveal it, all the feelings Just lead you to blow it
Something special Is undeniably run of the mill
Who is accepted? Who to reject? Who is neglected? Who can make the choice? Who is admitted? Who is denied? Who can discern with the human eye?
It's wrong, you know it Your gut should be telling you why Avoid it, discard it Avoid it, put it aside, now
So who is accepted? Who to reject? Who is neglected? Who can make the choice? Who is admitted? Who is denied? Who can discern, filled with human error?
Elusive answers stay just one step ahead Useless effort always one step ahead Think about it
The more you learn, the less you know The more you learn, the less you know You know
The more you look, the less you find The more you look, the less you find Who can say they're satisfied? Who can say they've found the answers?
Elusive answers stay just one step ahead
