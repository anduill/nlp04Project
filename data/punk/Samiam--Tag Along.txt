Tag along baby girl close behind tender sweet Tag along little feet all is well within your world Don't believe all you hear, never fear, never fear Shut your mouth tag along
She's too young for that She don't know, don't know Don't know not yet Shut your mouth
She's too young for that She don't know, don't know Don't know not yet I never even said a word
But she can see right through my eyes Still too young to understand
Should you go, should you go there? Should you go, should you go now? Everything, everything's alright Everything, everything's just fine
