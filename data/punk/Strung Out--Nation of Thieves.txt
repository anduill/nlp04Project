NATION! 
NATION! 
NATION OF THIEVES!

Veronica spends all day chasing little lies.
Penny's got something for the blues behind her eyes.
Eddie don't talk to much, he can barely stand the pain.
As the camera flickers on and on with visions of the end.

The beautiful and the insane waiting for our lucky number.
Start a war, gonna liberate this Nation of Thieves.

We like our angels bleeding for the love and the fall.
Manipulate reality to understand it all.

New abstract suicide, she gets off on a little blow now.
Mind fuck numb TV show we're a nation...

With a spiritual war in suburbia your Jesus wept.
Perpetual stimulation baby these angels never die.
The comedown always lasts too long and the well is always running strong.
As we pass the time with chemicals and the voices in my mind.

And now I see you still walk down these streets like some kind of zombie Jesus, 
flashing that big ol' Amerikan hole in your heart.
And your prescription's getting low and your cash flow's getting lower.
Feed the flesh, kill the mind and sink the heart.
Your spirit is just a chemical and your payment is due on the debts that you owe.
ON THE DEBTS THAT YOU OWE!

With a spiritual war in suburbia your Jesus wept.
Perpetual stimulation baby these angels never die.
The comedown always lasts too long and the well is always running strong.
As we pass the time with chemicals and the voices in my mind.

NATION OF THIEVES!
