No, I won't be silenced, I won't give in No, to the pressure of what's hip No, this simple lesson must be learned No, won't candy coat it, must be heard
Burry your head, hoping it all goes away Living state of apathy, don't wanna know Don't wanna hear what goes on Can't ignore there's something wrong
No, don't have time for fantasies No, can't escape reality No, won't shut my eyes, won't look away No, from the truth and the pain
Bury your head, hoping it all goes away Living state of apathy, don't wanna know Don't wanna hear what goes on Can't ignore there's something wrong
You close your eyes, try to deny You look away to shut it all out We'll defy, the candy coated lies Can't accept, pretending it's fine
Can't survive, with blinders on our eyes Seek the truth, reach the sublime We'll defy, the candy coated lies Can't accept, pretending it's fine
Open up your eyes It's too late See what's goin' on and recognize it's too late Time is running out, it's running out
It's too late Take a stand and see what it's about It's too late
