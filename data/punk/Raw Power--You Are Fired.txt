Hey you do this
Hey you do that
Don't say anything
You might regret
Hey you come here
Hey you stand back
Don't do anything
You might regret
Because you're fired,
Say no more
Because you're fired,
Say no more
But what about my family
Think of my kids
I don't give a shit
You're fired
I'm gonna tell your wife
About your mistress
I couldn't care less
You're fired
You're fired
