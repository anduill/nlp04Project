Come on
Come on
Don't be shy, it's only you and I
Isn't that what you want?
Oh yeah

Oh here I come

Come on then

Keep going
Keep going
Oh yeah
Keep going
Yeah

Here I, here I, here I come
(come with me)
Now
Come

Imagine what you look like from across the room
you're almost there

Come

Oh yeah

I love you
