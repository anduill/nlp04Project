The secret ept safely hid in your mind betrays you
on you look into my eyes
Broken are the bonds that used to bind you & I.
Broken like a promise bred from your world of lies.
Broken are the dreams, the ones you let slip away.
Trust me: two words I've heard once before.
Shelter your eyes from all that is real.
Broken and distorted, your reality within,
your fucked up little world's a shame of need and denial.
I can't stand by and let you lead me through this path
It's Broken.
Noises--the ones you hear in your mind.
They lead you away from something that's real.
