My lifes a book with the pages ripped out A jigsaw puzzle with one piece missing Living in the shadow of someone else Pictures of his life in my haunted house Mysteries of meanings all around me When I'm asleep the silence is broken Whispers of hell are so demanding Frustrated moments at a Hollywood screen Wearing a mask, do you know what I mean Heartbeats talk louder than dreams
Once gone but twice returned Lost emotions overheard Yes I can hear you Jimmy Dean But I'm alive, I'm not dead
He takes the fantasy to find an ending A lonely search of give and taking Running too fast to ever see he's alive Never understanding he wonders why Truth is the lodgers said goodbye
Once gone but twice returned Lost emotions overheard Yes I can hear you Jimmy Dean But I'm alive, I'm not dead
We have a 611 on highway 46 west of junction 7 A Porsche in the West hand lane A man dead can you send some assistance 10-4 Ambulance on the way ETA 10 minutes over Okay I'm waiting for assistance over Oh my god, I think it's James Dean
