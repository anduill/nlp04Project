My life
Go to work and go to school Get an education, won't be a fool Be a doctor, PhD, all that shit that's not for me
All my life people tell me what to say This is my life, live it my own way
Was so blind I couldn't see Figures of authority, always standing behind me Ready to come down on me
All my life people tell me what to say This is my life, live it my own way
