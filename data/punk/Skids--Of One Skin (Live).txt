Beware, little one knowledge
Inside, you seem to acknowledge
Traced the case of your family path
A maritime captain escaped the last laugh
Deep little one ponder
Sleep you seem to discover
Meandered the track of a right-angled road
Vesuvius my sheba erupted and gored
Silk little one slender
Certain part of the gender
A mother, a father, a brother, a son
A pyramid of love remembered you are the one
Beware little one knowledge
Inside do you acknowledge
