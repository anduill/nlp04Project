Who fed you to the lions?
When hanging from a tree
It's a case of melancholy
There's no tourists at the sea

Twelve saw decaying monuments
While marching on attack
Eleven watched a single
Thus continued on the march

Pin point toward horizon
Convalescent to the last
A moment lost of imagery
The last word to the cast
Won't you listen to the danger?
I can't listen any more
Oh, oh

This, oh, oh oh
This, oh, oh oh
This, to march along
This, on indwelt seed
This is a panorama
This is a soldier's creed

From this came a stranger
All the marching seemed to halt
From this came a moment
Then the march led to assault

The dwellers took position
While commanding genocide
The enemy were helpless
And there's lots more besides
Oh, oh

This, to march along
This, on indwelt seed
This is a panorama
This is a soldier's creed
This, oh, oh oh
This, oh, oh oh
