can only feel and think in the language of
Worn like the walls around you
Cliches otheres have concocted for you
Prefabricated pre-conception
All around you

How good to walk-with the caprice of God
How good to talk-with the caprice of God
So you can scratch the sky
Build your ivory tower

This totem has some use, the total of abuse
All that you have done, still adding up the sum
How could I forget that, you're not finished yet and that
Angry artillery on your tongue
Real life is never used as truth
Bows and arrows highly strung
Same shadow I can see right through
Whenever I picture you

How good to walk-with the caprice of God
An ordinary human-an ordinary mortal, and ordinary model
How good to talk-with the caprice of God

Build your ivory tower-so you can touch the sky
Don't hide inside the sentiment
The real test is never finished yet
Face up, collect the interest
Of all the idiots you should detest
How good to walk-with the caprice of God

An ordinary model
An ordinary human-an ordinary mortal-
How good to talk-with the caprice of God
