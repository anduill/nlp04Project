The choice is there for you to make
Which path in life you'll take
To give yr care and give yr love
And remember the emotions we all think of

Tryin' to help you think
In a positive way
So you can find whatcher lookin' for
Peace of mind + body
So you can turn off
All the hate

Think about yr brother
In a natural state of mind
So you don't have to think about
War + hate + politics + greed
Can you see my point of view?
Can you see my point in you?

Can you see where I'm coming from?
What its all about
Trying to help you think
Trying to help you live
POSITIVE!
The way ya wanna live!
