Think I care about what is happening?
Sure I do, but I'm still laughing.
World problems. We all care.
But has this rage got us anywhere?
No!
Keep a grin!
Think! Think Positive!
Sure, we'll sing about all our crying,
Unnecessary death and violence.
Do you think your negative attitude,
Is gonna give a starving man,
A plate full of food?
No!
Keep a grin
Think! Think Positive!
Keep Laughing!
Keep Laughing!
Ha, ha, ha
Keep a grin
Think! Think Positive!
Keep Laughing!
Keep Laughing!
Ha, ha, ha
Sure, we'll sing about all our crying,
Unnecessary death and violence.
Do you think your negative attitude,
Is gonna give a starving man,
A plate full of food?
No!
No!
No!
