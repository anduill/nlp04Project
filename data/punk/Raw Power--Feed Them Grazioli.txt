Feed,feed,feed them,Grazioli ! 
Feed,feed,feed them,Grazioli ! 
C'mon bill tell us a joke we don't get it
Two more lights then go right you turn left
let's eat here the food looks good
the next day we are all sick
don't park here it's a double line
2 minutes later we get fined
you know,you're just like us
you know,you'll never miss a chance
to have some fun with us!
what's the name of that song
you know them all and are never wrong
hey look at him,what's his name
your memory would put anybody to shame
go on bill tell us a story
we could listen to you 'till the morning
we're coming again and we want you around
we know you'd never let us down,
you know you're just like us, you know,you're never miss a chance
Feed,feed,feed them,Grazioli !
Feed,feed,feed them,Grazioli !
