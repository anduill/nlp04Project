Amaze yourself,amuse yourself
Cut and graze and abuse yourself
Get high by yourself when you're alone
But don't fill those animals eyes with cologne
your lipstick doesn't suit me, leave me alone
Give yourself a thrill, make yourself ill
Oh let me go home
Tie yourself down, cut youself up
Fuck with your mother then open her up
We need open spaces, not these high-rise cages
We don't want your hairsprays sprayed in our faces
your lipstick doesn't suit me, leave me alone
Give yourself a thrill, make yourself ill
Oh let me go home
Frankenstein was a philistine, him and my doctor are one of a kind
He injects me with drugs, threatens my life
I bet he does the same perverted things to his wife
your lipstick doesn't suit me, leave me alone
Give yourself a thrill, make yourself ill
Oh let me go home
