Clear your mind, hide your fear 
Don't look around, don't turn around 
Pennywise is here
Hide your feelings, hide your fear
Don't look around, don't turn around 
Pennywise is here

Evil lurks in his eyes 
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by surprise
The clown they call Pennywise

He's a monster, he's not human 
He's more than just a figment of your imagination 
You can't run, can't hide 
There's no way to escape Pennywise

Evil lurks in his eyes 
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by surprise
The clown they call Pennywise

He'll creep inside your soul at night and torment nice and slow 
Don't look around or turn around Pennywise will know 
He'll make you wish that you were dead and make it hard to cope 
He'll make you wish that you were dead and hanging by a rope

Evil lurks in his eyes 
The clown they call Pennywise
He'll catch you by surprise
The clown they call Pennywise

Clear your mind hide your fear 
Don't look around, don't turn around 
Pennywise is here.
