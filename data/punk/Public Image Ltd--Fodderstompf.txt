Be bland, be dull, be boring
Be really, really, y'know nothing
A void, zilch, zero, nought
Nothing, vacuum

Be in love
We wanted to be loved
We wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Oh love
Love makes the world go round
We only wanted to finish the album
With the minimum amount of effort
Which we are now doing very successfully

We only wanted to be loved
We only, love
We wanted to be accepted by society
We wanted to be accepted
We wanted to be accepted as people

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Love
We wanted to be loved

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

I'm just gonna go and get a cigarette
Do you want one?
Yes, please
Won't be a second, okay

Be bland
Be dull
Be boring
Be in love

Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Love

Every time I walk up and down the street
I look at people
And I think why don't you love me
Why don't you love me

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Oh, thank you wrong end

I'm in love

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

We need love
We need love like the water
Like the air we breathe, lovey
You know what I mean
Like where I cum from

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Only love can satisfy us
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

No one understands us
Nobody cares
No one loves us
Love makes the world go round

Oh, it does that as well
Without any mistake whatsoever
Love does make the world go round
I don't know what these punk rockers get up to
Y'know these punk rockers
With their spitting and their antics

Don't they realize
That love makes the world go round
Realize that love makes the world go round
Don't they realize that love,
That love, that love makes the world go round
Round

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Fucking hell
Thirsty work, innit being famous
This track is dragging on
Do you think it'll ever end

One more time?
What did you think of the engineer
Looking through that glass window?
I think he's rather suspicious
He looks very suspicious to me

Very dubious guy
With that long haired hippie roadie next to him
I think these long haired chaps
I don't really think much of them
But don't you like their jokes?
They don't realize that
Love makes the world go round

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

I will show our frustration at society
By picking up that fire extinguisher over there
And spraying it at the mic

We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

It's blue
Oh no
Oh yes

We only wanted to be loved
Go on, John tickle the old Joanna
We only wanted to be loved
Loved, loved
