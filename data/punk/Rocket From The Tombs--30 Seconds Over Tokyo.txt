Flew off early in the haze of dawn 
in a metal dragon locked in time, 
skimming waves of an underground sea 
in some kind of a dream world fantasy 

30 seconds, 
and a one way ride 
30 seconds, 
and no place to hide 

Sun a hot circle on a canopy, 
'25 a racing blot on a bright green sea 
Ahead the dim blur of an alien land, 
time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands 

30 seconds, 
and a one way ride 
30 seconds, 
and no place to hide 

Dark flak spiders bursting in the sky, 
reaching twisted claws on every side 
No place to run, 
no place to hide, 
no turning back on a suicide ride 

Toy city streets crawling through my sights, 
sprouting clumps of mushrooms like a world surreal 
This dream won't ever seem to end, 
and time seems like it'll never begin 
30 seconds, 
and a one way ride 
30 seconds, 
and no place to hide 
30 seconds over Tokyo etc.,
