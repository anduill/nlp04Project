You speak of Rastafari, but how can you justify
Belief in a god that's left you behind?
You simply fill the gap between the upper and lower class
And your faith merely keeps you in line

An amalgamation of Jewish scripture and Christian thought
What will that get you? Not a fuck of a lot
Take a look at your promised land, your deed is the gun in your hand
Mt. Zion's a minefield, the West Bank, the Gaza strip

The West Bank, the Gaza strip
The West Bank, the Gaza strip
The West Bank, the Gaza strip
Soon to be parking lots

For American tourists
And fascist cops, yeah
Fuck Zionism, fuck militarism
Fuck Americanism, fuck nationalism

Fuck religion, fuck religion
Fuck religion, fuck religion
Fuck religion, fuck religion
Fuck religion, fuck religion
