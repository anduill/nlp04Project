Drawing you in drawing you on Leading you in taking you on I can see potential
I can see intention With a pocket full of seeds
Hope keeps me alive Financing situations I can see contention
CHORUS And maybe may never be
Nothing comes from nothing No wisdom than the silence Negotiable affections Even lovers need lessons
Love bites trivia severely It has to be treated with respect CHORUS And-taken seriously-seriously-lonely CHORUS
I want to belong
