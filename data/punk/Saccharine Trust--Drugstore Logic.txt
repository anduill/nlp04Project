meet me in back of the drugstore
I got the world inside my trench coat
I'll give you the sense of well-being
that you will never know in this life

meet me baby...

meet me in back of the drugstore
I got your desires in a paper bag
only I know when and where
to give you your fulfillment

check out what daddy's carrying

heel bruises skull, skull bruises heel
evil is not when it's between satin sheets
little girls like you parade in their bondages
and sigh at my sacred scent of freedom

a tormented soul
a bought soul
a tormented soul
a bought soul
a tormented soul
a bought soul

which are you? which are you?
you're my walking candy store
