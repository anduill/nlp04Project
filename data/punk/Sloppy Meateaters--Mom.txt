For 20 years I acted so selfish
Pushed you away and took you for granted
You taught me so much, about loyality and love
I'll never forget how you put me above yourself

I'm really sorry mom, I've been a rotten son
I'm really feeling bad, you've been my mom and dad
I'm sorry mom, I've been a rotten son

You sold your soul, so I could eat
You blocked the dark, so I could read
You worked your fingers to the bone

You stood by me through all the tears
You bailed me out when noone cared

What do you think?
It matters, It matters, regardless, of what I say or do
It matters, it matters to me
