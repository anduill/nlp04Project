Remnants of the ancient heart remain
Time for one to seek an anti-soak
Bars for 3 and only room for 2
Box and box, a lift for legless hope

Sweet Suburbia

Living on the paper periscope
Hot dog life cold for the antelope
Concrete days and white electric nights
Steel and steel life on the open plain

Sweet Suburbia x 2

Excavate a land for restless days
Contemplate a chance for future ways
Clip and hate to centralise the world
Food and food and cardboard expatriates

Sweet Suburbia x 2

Birth and birth and birth and birth and birth
Live and live and live and live and live
Mate and mate and mate and mate and mate
Die and die and die and die and die

Sweet Suburbia...
