Charles got a job in a factory 
Drilling sheet metal from six till three 
Worked extra hours for a better wage 
Got lost in his task quite needlessly 

I noticed his brain was a plastic box 
His work rate improved 'cause he couldn't stop 
He couldn't eat lunch with those metal hands 
His legs were supports for new inner glands 

Next when I saw him his face was gone 
A stainless steel spine now instead of bone 
His arms became grafted onto the switch 
Six months without food made it quite a trip 

His wife soon returned from her open grief 
She told his employer she had kids to keep 
They gave her the scrap price of his machine 
Last weekend Charles became obsolete.
