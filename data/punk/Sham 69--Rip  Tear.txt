All foreign feet down Oxford street
Faces from places i've never been
All the shops and restaurants 
Ask for money i haven't got
I,ts just a fake make no mistake
A rip off for you but a rolls for them
Tell the kids get to grips
Don't wanna buy or eat no more
The kings road shopper make us poor


Time is running out for us
I'ts just a fake make no mistake
A rip off for you but a rolls for them
I'ts just a fake make no mistake
A rip off for you but a rolls for them
