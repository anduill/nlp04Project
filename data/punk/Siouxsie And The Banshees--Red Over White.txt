The woods and the town Covered in snow All transformed to a fairytale Like the fresh page Of a book opened up
Ready, waiting For the story to begin For you're all in a scene Objects in black ink
Fringed in white Breathing and living And anticipating A color
All transformed to a fairytale Unreal and inviting Inviting you to step in And follow the path never ending
You're now leaving Imprints And somehow expecting Expecting someone
Maybe the prince in disguise Suffering a snow queen curse But you're wrong of course It's in reverse
Out in the snow Muffled the last silent night The last sacrifice
Red running over white Red running over white Red running over white
Red running over white Running red over white Running red over white
Red over white Red over white Red over white
Running red over white Running red over white, all (Oh) Red over white Running red over white
Running red over white Red over white Red over white, all (Oh) Red over white
All (Oh) Red over white
