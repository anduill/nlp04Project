You know we're gonna get you 
You better watch your back 
A lonely night in the dark 
And well come for you 

I got my eyes, my eyes on you 
We always know what to do 

You'll never know what happened 
Before you're lying bleeding 
You'll never know what hit you 
In the dark well wait for you 

I got my eyes, my eyes on you 
We always know what to do 

You better watch your back
