 neat kind of song that sounds so pretty
A million selling single, a nice little ditty
A number one record, get it now
They wan't you to buy it, anyhow

Top 40, it makes me sick
Top 40, turn it off quick
Top 40, can't take any more
Top 40, oh what a bore

I heard it on the radio, it must be good
The dj played it, he said he would
Listener's rush out and make it a hit
But I can't stand to listen to it
