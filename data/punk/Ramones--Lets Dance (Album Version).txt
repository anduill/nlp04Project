Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance?
Well let's dance; let's dance.
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too.
Any old dance that you wanna do.
Well let's dance; let's dance.
Hey baby yeah you thrill the soul, hold me close, don't you let me go.
Well let's dance.
Hey baby if you're all alone, baby you'll let me walk you home.
Let's dance.
Hey baby yeah you swing it right, yes I know that tonight's the night.

Let's dance.
