No fun, my babe no fun
No fun, my babe no fun
No fun to hang around
Feeling that same old way
No fun to hang around
Freaked out for another day

No fun, my babe no fun
No fun, my babe no fun
No fun to be alone
Walking by my self
No fun to be alone
In love with nobody else

Well, maybe go out,
Maybe stay home
Maybe call Mom on the telephone
Well, come on, well, come on
Well, come on, well, come on
Well, come on, well, come on
Well, come on, well, come on
No fun to be alone
No fun to be alone
Hang on, don't let me go
No fun to be alone
