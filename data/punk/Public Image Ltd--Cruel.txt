Body and soul - an animal
As a sword - swing double edged
Dig deep down - that monthly frown
You have the tools - to make men fools
Cleopatra - the rat catcher
Preambling - eyeball shopping
You're measuring - your next victim
Too good to be sin - far too entertaining
She said the most evil thing
I can do
Is to give my body to you
In silhouette - the suffragette
Behind the scenes - the deadly schemes
Your best nightmare - without a prayer
From ship to shore - paramour l'amour
Inside our head - 22 lead
The modern miss - with modern gifts
In tragedy - hilarity
Never sin - far too entertaining
