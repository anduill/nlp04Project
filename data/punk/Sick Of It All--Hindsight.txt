Don't think of the could've beens
Don't think of what should've been
Weed out your weaknesses
piled up issue makes a mess
Don't think you had a chance
don't dwell on lost romance
Nothing is guaranteed
or caters to stupidity

They say life is what you make it
can't go back and try to change it
learn to live with your regrets

Choose a path choose it right
it's all there in black and white
disassociate joy and wealth
just don't even kid yourself

They say life is what you make it
can't go back and try to change it
choises that were made
opportunities
push away the pain and move on
with no delay
move on accept the shame
learn to live with your regrets
move on with no delay
move on accept the shame
it's all behind you anyw
