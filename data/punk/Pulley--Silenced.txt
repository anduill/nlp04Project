We're hanging out you want to go
the sink is full of yesterday's remains
Intelligence somewhat dim
You had the key to life did you make it fit
Which way is up which way is down
The person staring back at you
Always looks like he's somebody else
Overcome the greatest odds
Sacrifice is where the focus stems
Absolute the motion forward
Circumstance tells me I'll be back again
Which way is up which way is down
Pointing out the things you see
Grateful for what we have found
You go by that I know everything
That's enough for me
Wearing all the promises on you
Confidence comes with time gone by
Reach the top
Remember how to feel the glow
Silenced on the deaf ears
Responsible for everything it knows
