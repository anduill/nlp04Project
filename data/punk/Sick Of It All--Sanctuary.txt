This is for the one who saved me
accepts me for who i am, just me
and always gives back tenfold whatever i give
Respect was never ever questioned, every feeling reciprocated
mutual ideals and passion straight from the soul, from my soul
When i'm safely in your arms there i find my sanctuary
help me weather every storm, you're my sanctuary, my true love
There are those who tried to use you
even ones who would abuse you
they never took the time to see what i see
how you're always waiting for me kept me sane while all was crazy
and so i give you what's dearest to me
My true love the very first time you touched my soul
from that day on never want to let you
