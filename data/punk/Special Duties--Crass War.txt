I want a war between the rich and the poor
I want to fight and know what i'm fighting for

In a class war, crass war, class war, crass war
Class war, crass war, class war, crass war

In New York and LA, city halls are falling down
There's no escape, when a class war comes to town

I wanna kill, but i do not have a gun
There'll be a class war right here in America
