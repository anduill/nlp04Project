Running away
She was running away
She had no more words to say
She said "No sense - it makes a lot of sense"
I said "You're talking absolute nonsense"
And she said "Well, I'm an existentialist, you know"

We all sit on someones fence
We all use a little pretense
Riot in my eye
Right in the sky
Hookah, Baby
Hookah chalice, Baby
Suck on my chalice, Baby

Running away
She was running away
She had no more games for me
She said "No sense - it makes a lot of sense"
I said "You're talking absolute nonsense"
And she said "Well, I'm an existentialist, you know"

We all use a little defence
We all sit on someones fence
Riot in my eye
Right in the sky
Hookah, Baby
Hookah chalice, Baby
Suck on my chalice, Baby
Suck on it
Suck on it
Suck on it
Suck
Suck
Suck
Riot in my eye
Right in the sky
Hookah, Baby
Hookah chalice, Baby
Suck on my chalice, Baby
Suck on it

Riot in my eye
Right in the sky
Hookah, Baby
Hookah chalice, Baby
Suck on my chalice, Baby

Running away
We were running away
We had no more games to play
She said "No sense - it makes a lot of sense"
I said "You're talking absolute nonsense"
And she said "Well, I'm an existentialist, you know"

We all use a little pretense
We all sit on someones fence
Riot in my eye
Riot in the sky
