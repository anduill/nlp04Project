I got in a fight with the stenographer 
Afterwards she read me like a book. 
I had tried to get along with her 
But my temperament was quickly overlooked. 

On the weekends we can 
Sneak into this courtroom 
And you'll offer me some sort of bargain plea. 

Yeah, Smith and Weston (Wesson) Jr. was a son of a gun 
He pressed his nose up to my head. 
Yeah, I was sweatin' bullets but I dodged the one 
That was not as much sweat as was lead. 

Oh, I still love you
Oh, I still love you,
Although I know that you want me dead. 
And when I turn my other cheek 
I will beg and I'll plead 
That this time you might just kiss it instead. 

Cause this is my story 
And like the glue on the binding, 
I'm sticking to it. 
If you wanna implore me 
To change my tune, 
Well I just won't do it. 

Cause this is my story 
And like the glue on the binding,
