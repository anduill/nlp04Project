Hey wheres spot?
Mom wheres spot?
He ran away

Run spot run
Run spot run

At 6 the milkman comes around
Another day in anytown
I wake up with a frown
Another day in anytown

Run spot run
Run spot run

I called up Sally, Dick and Mark
We took my dog spot to the park
We watched him run and heard him bark
Then spot ran way into the dark

Run spot run
Run spot run

I had to go and tell my dad
I said "Anytown just makes me sad"
He said "Son, thats pretty bad"
He said "I must be going mad"

Take him away!
Take him away!
Take him away!
Take him away!

I dont want to live in anytown
Anytown just brings me down
I dont want to live in anytown
Anytown just makes me frown
