1. The essence of outlandish dreams 
Is the wake, and the daylight 
Is the sweats of nighttime screams 
Surrounded by crystal veils 
In this position, it seldom fails 

Chorus 
I have hope and glory 
Redeeming my life story 
I have hope and glory 
Dissolving all of my worry 

2. The emotion of paper words 
Is the lost, and the love 
Raucous writers seem lost for words 
Failing this the authors dream 
Transcend all else, the poetic scheme 

Chorus 
I have hope and glory 
Redeeming my life story 
I have hope and glory 
Dissolving all of my worry 

3. The blemish of the failing rise 
Is the sustain, and the fear 
Reject advice to accept the cries 
When all of this is gone 
This a time, not for forlorn. 

Chorus 
The man on the dolphin's side 
Shine, silver diamond 
Escape, prospectors, mine 
Collect, enhance your children 
Cherish, stalemate black on white 
Shine, silver stallion 
Prepare, the final ride 
Victory, victory over victory 
The man, the man on the dolphin's side
