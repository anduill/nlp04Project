So to the best, to the best of our knowledge
We are doing our best to fight technology
'Cause back when our parents were in college
We weren't even born and neither were CD's

'Cause when our folks would listen to their rock 'n' roll
They'd gather round and play it on their turntables
But these days, their records are worthless
'Cause DJ's scratch the records on purpose

So let's put this in a perspective
In the present day in which we live
It's all the same with all the kids
No one knows what vinyl is

'Cause they just burn the MP3's
Onto their stacks of blank CD's
And during all that arsony
The records stay right in their sleeves

It's all the same with all the kids
'Cause no one knows what vinyl is

'Cause these days kids they act so ignorant
They have no clue what to do with a 7 inch
They say, "It won't play, it's my CD player's fault
I'll take it to the park and play some Frisbee golf"

So give me side A, give me side B
It really doesn't make any difference to me
I tried to burn it, like all the CD's that I get
But what the heck is all this melted plastic mess?

Let's put this in a perspective
In the present day in which we live
It's all the same with all the kids
No one knows what vinyl is

'Cause they just burn the MP3's
Onto their stacks of blank CD's
And during all that arsony
The records stay right in their sleeves

It's all the same with all the kids
'Cause no one knows what vinyl is

So let's put this in a perspective
In the present day in which we live
It's all the same with all the kids
No one knows what vinyl is
