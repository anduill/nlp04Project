Down by the racetrack waiting with their signs The ugly broken people got no place to go And a guilty boy scout with his conscience in his hand Buys some reconciliation
Ain't going to be me, no, thinking Ain't going to be me, no, thinking Ain't going to be me, no Only 29 years left on my loan
You stand there freezing on the side of the road To remind me of all the good things that I'm so glad I own The only reason I leave you in the cold Is if I took you home to feed you, you'd be somebody I know
And on the corner you tell me the same old lies Like I believe you gas can guy Every single dollar that I gave you and you drank How many gallons are in your tank?
Ain't going to be me, no, thinking Ain't going to be me, no, thinking Ain't going to be me, no Only 29 years left on my loan
You stand there freezing on the side of the road To remind me of all the good things that I'm so glad I own The only reason I leave you in the cold Is if I took you home to feed you, you'd be somebody I know
And on the corner you tell me the same old lies Like I believe you gas can guy Every single dollar that I gave you and you drank How many gallons are in your tank?
The only reason I leave you in the cold
