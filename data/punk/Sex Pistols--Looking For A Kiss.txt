An imitation from New York You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk You're hippy tarts hero 'cos you put on a bad show You put on a bad show, oh, don't it show
Still out on those pills Oh, do you remember?
Think it's swell playing Max's Kansas You're looking bored and you're acting flash With nothing in your gut you better keep your mouth shut You better keep your mouth shut, in a rut
Still out on those pills Do the sambo
You're four years on, you still look the same I think it's about time you changed you brain You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this You poor little fagot You're sealed with a kiss Kiss me
Think it's swell playing in Japan When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this You poor little fagot You're sealed with a kiss
Still out on those pills Cheap thrills, Anadins, Aspros anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit You're sealed with a kiss Kiss me
A kiss, a kiss, you're sealed with a kiss A looking for a kiss, you're coming to this I wanna kiss
You do just about anything Oh, kiss this Eh, boy
