Yeah!
Oh, believe me I have tried
to work this out from the inside
then I finaly realized I need to move on with my life

[Chorus]
Gotta make something happen
not just sit around and wait for it 
this place is like a prison I think I'm going to have to make a break for it
whoa-o here I go it's like I made it for the first time
whoa-o here I go and I think it's the first time I felt alive

Yeah! Alive!
I've been so depressed I've been let down
been pushed aside been pushed around 
there's one thing that I need
something you can't take from me

[Chorus]
Gotta make something happen
not just sit around and wait for it
this place is like a prison I think I'm going to have to make a break for it
whoa-o here I go it's like I made it for the first time
whoa-o here I go and I think it's the first time I felt alive
whoa-o here I go it's like I made it for the first time
whoa-o here I go and I think it's the first time I felt alive

Move up, move on 
you blink I'm gone 
we only have one life to live
I'll live it now 
you have no doubt
I'll prove you wrong
this is the only thing that I know 
so here I go 

[Chorus]
whoa-o here I go it's like I made it for the first time
whoa-o here I go and I think it's the first time I felt alive
whoa-o here I go it's like I made it for the first time
whoa-o here I go I think it's the first time I felt alive.
