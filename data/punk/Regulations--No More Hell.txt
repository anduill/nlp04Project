I hear the talk about the truth 
I'm telling you they got no proof 
They're still waiting for the savior to come 
Good luck he's nailed to a cross 

No more praise 
No more lies 
No more hell 
'cause there's no god 

They got their books and scriptures 
Believe every word or you'll die 
I don't believe in no pope no god 
No more preaches of Christ 

No more praise 
No more lies 
No more hell 
'cause there's no god 

No kneeling, no lies 
No heaven, no Christ 
No hell, no more 

No more praise 
No more lies 
No more hell 
'cause there's no god
