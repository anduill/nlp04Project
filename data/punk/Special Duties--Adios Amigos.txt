Hey joey, hey johnny
And the brothers who came and go
I was at adios amigos
The final farewell show

And i wouldn't of had it any other way
Final respects were the order of the day

And it was cool, it was fun and the hits kept coming
I miss you so and my head keeps humming
To the chords of sheena, jackie and judy
Suzy headbanging and headcase heidi

And oh i just don't know
Why i can't let you go
And oh i don't know why
Why i can't let you go

I just don't care if people think i'm mad
'cos losing you for good has only left me sad

Gabba gabba, gabba gabba hey
Gabba gabba, gabba gabba hey
Gabba gabba, gabba gabba hey
Gabba gabba, gabba gabba hey
