Should be the end of an era An era of control That keeps minds lost in their identity
The power that exists alone Should be finished, should be done The suffocation can't go on
Choke on the world While just staring at the sun A spoon fed zombie can't be discerning one
Never had the chance to be the thoughtful one Never had the chance to break from being numb Once and for all
End the era, let it go End the era of control End the era, turn it off
Reach the ones who aren't lost Should be the end of an era An era of monopoly
Should be stripped of all authority Monopoly exists alone Should be buried, should be gone
A real effort never made To get a special kind of look or thought or trait The plain and obvious course is prearranged
The opportunity to take the simple path Without the knowledge that the straight away Won't last, it just won't last
End the era, let it go End the era of control End the era, turn it off
Reach the ones who aren't lost Let it go, let it go, turn it off Reach the ones who aren't lost
