Ooh, I can't hold it 
Ow! (Bang, b-b-bang, bang) 

Bang 
Ooh 
Yeah, yeah, uh 

U're such a big tease 
U get me all excited, all excited 
And then U go home 
U're like ice cream 
Knew I got 2 eat cha, got 2 eat cha 
Before U're all gone 

U're such a bombshell 
And if I ever get cha, ever get cha, ever get cha 
There's no tellin' how long I'd last 
Before I tick, tick, tick, bang all over U 
Tick, tick, tick, bang, bang all over U 
Tick, tick, tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang 

U ain't no cheap thrill 
Every time U tick, I'd rather U bang 
But U leave me in a fire sweat (Leave me in a fire sweat) 
U're like a good pill 
All I need is 2 and I'm so into U 
U're the best stuff that I could get 

U're such a bombshell 
If I ever get cha, ever get cha, ever get cha 
There's no tellin' how long I'd last 
Before I tick, tick, tick, bang all over U 
All over U {x2} 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 

Ooh, I can't hold it 
Ooh, it's gettin' all over me 
Ooh, I can't hold it 
Ooh, it's gettin' all over me 

U're such a queen bee 
Let me taste your honey, taste your honey 
Taste your honey 'fore I go mad 
U're so slippery, ooh 
Like this chain around my hip 
I want a 24K relationship 
So baby, don't spit me out 
Tick, tick, bang 
All over U 
Tick, tick, tick, bang, ow! 

Ooh, I can't hold it 
Ooh, it's getting' all over me 
U're such a bombshell 
And if I ever get cha, ever get cha, ever get cha 
There's no tellin' how long I'd last 
Before I tick, tick, tick, bang 
Tick, bang, bang all over U, all over U 
Bang all over U, all over U 
Tick, tick, bang all over U, all over U 
Tick, tick, bang, all over U, bang all over, bang all over 
Tick, bang!
