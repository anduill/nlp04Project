When's the last time you've tasted their salty taste?
And you've had their feelings running down your face?
And you've cried and cried till you felt good inside
You cried and cried till your heart wrung dry

Are you the emotional cripple you were taught to be? 
If you cry, is it a sign of latency? 
To keep your emotions locked up inside
Means you're only living half your life

Sometimes these tears...are out of sadness
Sometimes these tears...are out of madness
Sometimes they're the voice of happiness
And sometimes they're just tears
