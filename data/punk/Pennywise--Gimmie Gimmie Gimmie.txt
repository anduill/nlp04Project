Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for

Sitting here i'm a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off

Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for

You know i'm gonna go out
Get something for my head
If i keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead

Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
With an atom bomb

Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
