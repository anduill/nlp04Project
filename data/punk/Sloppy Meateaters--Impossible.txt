I came into this a poor man and I'll leave just the same
I am disgusted sad and angry and I feel so ashamed
But you're forgetting one thing, you're forgetting one thing
I made you I'll break you

Complication - I'm not leaving
This Operation - will leave you screaming
Goddamn Impossible
Way of life you're living boy
You better run you better hide
You better learn to decide
Surprise are you flattered by their little lies
Or do you

People say I have changed well I hope I have changed
A moment of clarity I have gained
A lifetime of darkness I move to the light
And with this hope I will survive
I believe and I believe
And forever I will Believe
