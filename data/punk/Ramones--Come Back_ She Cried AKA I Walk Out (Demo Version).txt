oh oh no nothing to worry about oh oh no nothing to worry about

oh oh no nothing to worry about oh oh no nothing to worry about
i lied, i lied come back, come back come back, she cried i freaked out, i freaked out, i freaked out is the water as high as it'll get super wet, mom told me, every chance i have seen trying to get clean
oh oh no nothing to worry about oh oh no nothing to worry about i lied, i lied come back, come back come back, she cried i lied, i lied i tried, i tried come back, come back come back, she cried i lied, i lied oh oh no nothing to worry about
