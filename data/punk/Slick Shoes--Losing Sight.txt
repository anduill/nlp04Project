Sorry it turned out like this I guess it's time for us to take Our own separate ways
All I can do is pray That you would make the right decisions And never lose sight of what is real
All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands
You're losing your grip on reality You don't know what's real And what is rally in your head
You haven't learned, you never will Unless you let God do what He wants And not what you want to do
All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands
All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands All the time I wonder why it turned out like this It doesn't matter, it's in God's hands
