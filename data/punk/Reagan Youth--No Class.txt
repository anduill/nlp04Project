The old bat says I have no manners
Pardon me my manner is my own
I might not climb the social ladder
But I can climb the schoolyard fence

Got no class
I said got no class
I said got no class
I'm just my fucking self

The old timer tries to socialize me
And keep me neatly in my place
Excuse me I'm not a category
And cheap repression's not my taste

Got no class
I said got no class
I said got no class
I'm just my fucking self

And at times I might be gentle
Don't mean that I'm a gentleman

Got no class
I said got no class
I said got no class
I'm just my fucking self

I'm just my indescribable indefinable unique self
I ain't no performance art
