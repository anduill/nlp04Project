Hey you...
Sad-eyed people sat in bars Sad-eyed People sat in bars
In the corner there's the party with the birthday Its quite happy but its quite sad because no one's there and no one cares Least of all me
Sad-eyed people sat in bars Sad-eyed People sat in bars
A mother and father consoling a daughter The guy who threw her over, at the weekend, doesn't matter he's as mad as a hatter to pass on a jewel like you
Sad-eyed people sat in bars Sad-eyed People sat in bars
A husband and wife never of the one-armed bandit Hand it to them, they always almost win and its something to talk about I suppose
They're all
Sad-eyed people sat in Sad-eyed people sat in Sad-eyed people sat in Sad-eyed people sat in they sat in bars
Over there there's a young couple laughing No-one notices or pays them any heed Cos we've got what we need Except for me
I'm a
Sad eyed boy who sits in sad eyed boy who sits in sad eyed boy who sits in bars
