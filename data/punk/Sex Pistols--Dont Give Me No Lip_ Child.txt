"(Don't Give Me) No Lip (Child)"

Don't you give me no lip child
Don't you talk back to me
You're no lip child
That ain't the way it's gonna be

If you wanna love true, true lovin'
You'd better stop
Pushin' and a-shovin'
pushin' and a-shovin'

Don't you give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
No lip child
Or you'll be someone dead
Breakin' outta my lovin'
You'd better stop
Pushin' and a-shovin'
Pushin' and a-shovin'
Pushin' and a-shovin'

No more lip

No lip child
Don't you talk back to me
You're no lip child
That ain't the way it's gonna be
Breakin' outta my lovin'
You'd better stop
You'll be sorry
You'll be sorry

Oh give me no lip child
And I mean what I say
You're no lip child
You'll be someone dead
You're breakin' outta my lovin'
You'd better stop
You'll be sorry
You'll be sorry
You'll be sorry

No more lip

No lip [repeat until end of song]
