Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
Close to me
I never thought I'd get her close to me

Now the moon and the sun belong to me
All my wildest hopes
My crazy dreams
They seem more like reality

Fantasy
This girl fulfills my every fantasy
She must be
Specially designed by heaven just for me
(Just for me)

My friends look at her
They see mystery
But I look at her and I see a masterpiece
Can it be, I mean really did she?

Spoke to me
Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
Speak to me baby, speak to me baby

Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
And if she hurts me
I'll take it all with open arms you see, you think I won't?

'Cuz like a track
Under a subway train
She could roll all over me
And I'd still be the same

'Cuz today is the day she spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
Close to me
I never thought I'd get her close to me

If I'm stuck in some groovy wet dream
Don't pinch me
I don't wanna wake up
I'm diggin' the scene, yeah baby
(Diggin', diggin', yeah baby)

I'm diggin' the scene
I'm diggin' the scene, yeah baby
