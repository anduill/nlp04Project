I've been staying in watching television While my mates got put in prison You don't care what's happening to me You don't care what's happening to me
I went out on a Saturday night I got in a bleedin' fight All the lads came down with me I ended up in the bleedin' gutter
Who wants to screw Do you screw do I don't care what you say You can screw anyway
You don't care about me You don't care about me I've been out every night I didn't wanna end up in a fight
