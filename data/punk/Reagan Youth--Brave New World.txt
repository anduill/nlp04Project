Oh Brave New World
That has such people in it
How beauteous mankind is

Oh brave new world
That has such robots in it
How beauteous mankind is

I see a perfect alpha-plus
I see an epsilon-minus
Everybody in their place
I take a soma holiday
To be born without face
Problems conveniently erased
And the matter of sex and erotic play
I take a soma holiday
Is this utopia, the dream of mankind?
Livin' your life on a factory line
Is this utopia, dream of mankind?
Livin' your life from nine to five

And the word was given,
And Babylon was destined to fall,
So hear the world and remember now...

Ending Is Better Than Mending,
Ending Is Better Than Mending,
Ending Is Better Than Mending,
[whispered]
ending is better than mending...
