Ain't you tired of working 8 hours a day
When you get home you're much too tired to pray
You better watch out for what you do
That man on the corner's lookin' at you
The big guys do what they want to
They're making laws to control you
I'm a man you better set me free
Someone up there better stick up for me, yeah!

Don't you think that the millions
Are getting tired of being governed by the few
They send you out to fight the war
While they stay at home to control you
The big guys do what they want to
They're making laws to control you
I'm a man you better set me free
Someone up there better stick up for me, yeah!

Look at the mountains baby, look at the trees
Look at the birds up in the sky, ain't they free?
Look at the fishes in the deep blue sea
And won't you please tell me why the
Big guys do what they want to
They're making laws to control you
I'm a man you better set me free
Someone up there better stick up for me, yeah!

Someone up there better stick up for me! (x3)
