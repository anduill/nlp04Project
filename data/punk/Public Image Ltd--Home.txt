Better days will never be
Better days will never be
Better days will never be

Now what does this mean
It means we get the best scene
When politics talk, the ends of power meet
Nice to be wanted, safe and protected
The ends of power when politics talk

Better days will never be
Better days will never be
Better days will never be

Better days will never be
Home sweet home
Home, home

Now let's talk politics
Every dog has its day
For me, I don't believe
(For me, I don't believe in anything)
Better days ahead will never be
(One more war, I do believe no more)
I don't believe in anything
(No long goodbye, nuclear day)

Better days will never be
Better days will never be
Better days will never be

Spare no man
Match bomb for bomb
War, all is fair in war
When the ground is soft with hot blood
Spare no man

Better days will never be
(match bomb for bomb)
A scorched earth, no charity
(Flatten the earth, this home sweet home)
(Burn everything, from lust to dust)
No weak pity from lust to dust
(No charity, no weak pity, all is fair in war)

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
