She had a dream that dated back to school
In a time when things faded out so
Chased it with desire, set the world on fire
Left all her friends and family behind

Pictures made her dirty, movies far from clean
Did the things she thought she'd never do
Stepping-stones to glory and that spiral down to hell
Cover up the wounds, they won't come clean

Electrified, enough money buys
Too many bills and it's time to kill
Lucky I resist all temptation

Revolving doors go round
Her appearance for a need
A scene that's hard to be noticed
Do everything to chase her dreams

Living only to touch the moon
But you never leave the ground
They'll try to take away your will
And they'll try to push you down

Purified, not so qualified
Ever since the day that it changed your life
Terrified by the world outside
They told me that I would never fit in

Electrified, enough money buys
Too many bills and it's time to kill
Lucky I resist all temptation

Next time I think I'll run away
Run away
Run away

I'm alive 
I'm alive again
