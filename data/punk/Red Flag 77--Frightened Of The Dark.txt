Leave the light on there's some-one in my room
It's friday the 13th and it's a full moon
Peter Cushing is outside my door
I can hear his footsteps as he walks across the floor
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
Boris Karloff is underneath my bed
I must Stay quiet or I will end up dead
Christopher Lee is outside in the hall
I must stay silent or he will hear my call
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
Bela Lugosi is looking through the blinds
He's taking people over and punishing their minds
Vincent Price is coming up the stairs
Ev'rybody's sleeping now, does anybody care
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
Can't close my eyes, can't go to sleep I'm frightened of thge dark
