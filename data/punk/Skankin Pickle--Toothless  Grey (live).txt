Here I sit and rack my brain
Remaining borderline insane
The things I try to keep inside
Allow no room for compromise
I have a voice I want to hear
But what exactly do I fear?
Do I know how long
I've been waiting for?

I can feel it coming on the inside
I can feel it, 'cause it's always the same
I don't want all the answers, just a little piece of mind
Is is like this 'till I'm toothless and grey?

An open mind before a mouth
I never really had a doubt
Things I learned from observation
Lacking now with concentration
Got a voice I want to hear
What exactly do I fear?
Do I know how long
I've been waiting for?

I can feel it coming on the inside
I can feel it, 'cause it's always the same
I don't want all the answers, just a little piece of mind
Is is like this 'till I'm toothless and grey?

Here I sit and rack my brain
Remaining borderline insane
The things I try to keep inside
Allow no room for compromise
I have a voice I want to hear
But what exactly do I fear?
Do I know how long
I've been waiting for?

I can feel it coming on the inside
I can feel it, 'cause it's always the same
I don't want all the answers, just a little piece of mind
Is is like this 'till I'm toothless and grey?
