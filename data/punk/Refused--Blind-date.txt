So you want to go out with me
Watch me get on my knees and bleed?
I stole this scrapbook from you
Doesn't matter cos you stole it to
Sugarcoated kisses from my lips
Gives the exitement of a stolen bliss
To create, to love & fight
To create, to love & fight
To create, to love & fight
We won't sleep at all tonight

So you wanna watch me scream,
Dance with me and watch me bleed?
Steal the sound and love it too
Then baby I'll howl for you
Confused & exhausted with a healthy fix
Let's drink some potion and get it over with

Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Bring their idols down
Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Kick their idols down

They're screaming about the rock'n'roll
I would say that it's getting old.
Belongs to the museum
It's rotten soul been sold
Explosive &crude
Out of line and out of tune
Somehow knowing that
We'll get the message through

Hang on as the rebirth of cool takes place
You'll know the time, we'll set the pace

So you want to go out with me
Watch me get on my knees and bleed?
I stole this scrapbook from you
Doesn't matter cos you stole it to
Sugarcoated kisses from my lips
Gives the exitement of a stolen bliss
To create, to love & fight
We won't sleep at all tonight

Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Bring their idols down
Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Kill their idols
Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Brake their idols down
Shake it around, shake it around, shake it around
Move across town
Kick their idols down
