Let’s talk about the way things were
Let’s talk about the way things should be
I think I’m certain but I’m not so sure
If I’ll deliver what’s expected of me
Let’s make believe we’re all okay
Better yet pretend we’re doing better than we’ve ever been
I think it’s safe to say we’ve forgotten what regrets were

‘Cause that's exactly what a catastrophe is
Ignoring warnings, thinking kids will be kids will be
A delusion kept at a distance
I think it's strange to have to fight resistance
We're gonna get it right for the first time
We're gonna get it right, gonna get it right
We're gonna get it right for the first time
Unmask ourselves
And we'll find...

We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You

I've given up on acting like I'm perfect
I advise you all to do the same
Perfection's rare
So the last time I checked
We've all been introduced to feeling ashamed

Let's talk about the way things were
Let's talk about the way things should be
I think I'm certain but I'm not so sure
If I'll turn my back as soon as God lets me

Cause that's exactly what a catastrophe is
Ignoring warnings
Thinking kids will be kids will be
A delusion kept at a distance
I think it's strange to have to fight resistance
We're gonna get it right for the first time
We're gonna get it right, gonna get it right
We're gonna get it right for the first time
Cause when we try it alone
Then we find...

We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
(And it's been brought to my attention
That nothing's really worth the mention)
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
(When me and You, subtract the latter
Equals nothing really matters)

You make me sure, in the midst
Of heartbreak and turbulence
That my spirit soars
Only because it's Yours

We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
(And it's been brought to my attention
That nothing's really worth the mention)
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
(When me and You, subtract the latter
Equals nothing really matters)

We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
We're nothing, we're nothing, we're nothing without You
