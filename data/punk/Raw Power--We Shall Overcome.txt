I remember reading when I was young 
All those great stories about red indians
I remember watching a lot of films on T.V.
Where the indians had power and were free
How different, how sad it was
To see that now it's not like that anymore
We shall overcome
We shal overcome
No more surrender
No more reservation
We shall overcome
We shall overcome
I saw things there that just aren't fair
Living in places where there is no work
Where the only thing to do is drink and get stoned
Thinking about the past
Dreaming about better times to come
We shall overcome
We shall overcome
