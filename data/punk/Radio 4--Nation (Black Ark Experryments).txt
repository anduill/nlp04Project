All around us and in between Politics like cancer Information in extremes Never find the answers
Events unfolded Set the stage We know they have us In every way
They held a grudge For way too long I feel that danger Coming on
I have grave expectations For this strange situation I signed my letter of resignation For the stealing of a nation
Cut your losses Get the votes Come fall, they'll change Every single quote
Heavy ammunition Targets in sight Inhuman nature Fills me with fright
Do your life justice It won't take long
