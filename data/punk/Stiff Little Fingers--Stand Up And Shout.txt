It's time to ask yourself just what you want to be Just look around tell me exactly what you see No sitting out, no chance to settle in your place You're with us now, don't be a name without a face
Stand up and shout for what you want to be Stand up and shout what you believe Stand up and shout for those you want to free Stand up for the one and only
Get on your feet and raise your fist up for the count What's yours is yours if you will just stand up and shout No looking back, you got to play the cards you're dealt Break down the barricades and speak up for yourself
Stand up and shout for what you want to be Stand up and shout what you believe Stand up and shout for those you want to free Stand up for the one and only
Don't you know who speaks up for you You can't rely on no one else to pull you through
So what you're think might be what we want to hear Don't keep it hidden, got to shout your message clear No easy answers when the question is self doubt Better wrong than silent, gotta let your feelings out
