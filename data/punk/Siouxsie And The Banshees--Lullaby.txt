The lunacy will leave the day Luminous in flight As the moon spits out in jagged Beams another night
Wrap around this brilliant veil Tranquil and unbroken As you spiral down, a world of clay And taut convulsion
The dream swan spins And cartwheel turns
Down deep within your violet side The sun begins to rise Shaking down its morning swords To thaw your frozen eyes
The dream swan spins And so conceal the heart That aches and yearns Oh, hush awhile, sleepless child
I'll be watching over you I'll be watching over you I'll be watching over you I'll be watching over you
