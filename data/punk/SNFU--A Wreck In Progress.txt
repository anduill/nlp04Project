Beaten down by the pouring rain,
At least it rinses off the mortal pain,
The wet bullet grazed the right side of
his brain,
Leaving him with more than a migraine.

Broad daylight,
Ainâ€™t the best time,
For souls to take flight,
Itâ€™s so easy
To lose sight of the good things in life.

Some invisible Saint has the final say,
As to how and when we leave this place,
Ancient monks have often said,
If you take your own life, you must
live it again.

Broad daylight...
When sunlight threatens to burn out your eyes.

Iâ€™m just a wreck,
A wreck in progress,

Itâ€™s so easy
To lose sight of the good things in life. [x2]
