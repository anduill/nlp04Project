I once believed when I was only thirteen
They all laughed at me they all laughed at me

Can you believe what they're selling me
No sex no drugs no Satanism, can you believe

So there he was talking bout Jesus
He's in my face for all the wrong reasons
He's trying to clean my body of demons
But he won't save me

He follows me starts to point and yell
You better give your soul to Jesus
Or you'll burn in hell

I believe it's dumb to fight
When we both know that I'm right
