He seemed shy and so confused
Now that he's older, he's last year's news
She is looking for somebody fresh and young 
She is looking for someone less miserable

She's looking for somebody better
Much better than Eddie Vedder

His pictures used to line her locker
But they don't hang there any longer
She has gone, and she has burned them all
Eddie comes crashing down from her bathroom wall

Now she's looking for somebody cuter
Someone more fun who rides a scooter 
Eddie hides his face under a jokeshop mask 
Eddie, you missed the grade, you failed the test

She's looking for somebody better
Much better than Eddie Vedder
