Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishin' every show was the last show
(Wishin' every show was the last show)

So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Like I always do
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still I'm thinkin' about you only
(Still I'm thinkin' about you only)

There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
And it's gonna be alright
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different

When I'm on the stage tonight

Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Like I always do
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me, I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Tonight the
Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

Tonight the
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Like I always do
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shinin' like the sun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Smilin', havin' fun
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Feeling like a number one

Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
Like I always do
(Su-p-per Trou-p-per)
