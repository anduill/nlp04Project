I said Chatterbox
I said ya squalk a lot
C'mon gimma some lips
Yeah Chatterbox

I call you up
Don't give me no line

On the chatterline

All dressed up
I got nowhere to go
Seems like fun night
On the telephone

Call you up
Don't give me no line

On the telephone

All dressed up

Seems like fun night
On the telephone
