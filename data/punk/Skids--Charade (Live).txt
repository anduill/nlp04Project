The band still played 
Through the interval 
Candle lit but the room was still 
While two men dealt amongst the chill 

Charade... 

The stakes were high but the danger low 
Without a friend these risks would grow 
This the night their eyes would glow 

Charade... 

The band played on like a dazzling flame 
Another card for the burning game 
Selling solitude to ease the blame 

Charade... 

Then the time came to run or choose 
Either way one would fail and lose 
Gamble a partner and dim the fuse 

Charade...
