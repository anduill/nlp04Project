We pride ourselves in the integrity of our herds
but our words are just words are just words
While the brand you wear is the same as mine
cant be out of step if we're still in line!

One more round
One more round
We wouldnt want to trade new ground
One more round

another circle drawn
for another carbon copy
as we limit ourselves
to the flag of our flock

Circle pit ' mentality
individ removal
Cut to fit
for punkrock herd approval

A shepard vacancy
but dont look to us
All that phony mania
has bitten the dust

Circle complete
in the imitation zone '
Find a new king for your throne!
Find a new king for your throne!

One more round
One more round
We would'nt want to trade new ground
One more round
