let me take you to a place that no one's ever seen.
it's so far it's far away back in deep behind the trees.
i know that it won't fall
it's been there a hundred years,
trust the limbs are here one more time.
i'm telling you, walk where you won't fall.
follow me and i'll follow you,
i want to take you there.
to the place that no one's ever seen,
the moss grows on the north side of the trees,
walk through the forest at night.
