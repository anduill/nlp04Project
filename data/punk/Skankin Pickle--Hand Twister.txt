You might laugh at the things I wear
You might laugh at the way I have my hair
You might like me, you might hate me
But you have to take me the way I am

You might laugh at the things I say
We might not share the same point of view, but that's okay
You might like me, you might hate me
But you have to take me the way I am

You might laugh at the things I wear
You might laugh at the way I have my hair
You might like me, you might hate me
But you have to take me the way I am

You might like me, you might hate me
You might like me, you might hate me
You might like me, you might hate me
But you have to take me the way I am
