My bag of tricks is far from empty, don't bust my chops Don't try and tempt me 'cause I will stick the truth in your face There's only one race, the human race, propagandic ways and abuse Set to separate and confuse for five hundred years The barriers been there and they're not moving anywhere
Who the fuck are we to separate and support their actions of hate? Knowledge is the key to unlock the mind, the imperialistic system That invented prejudice and misbelief, they still benefit from it They still do as they please, inject us with reasons of contemplation And dissatisfaction to assure that
We remain sedated to their segregative actions In our years of existence, has our modern society Gotten any closer to equality where people openly are being oppressed Because of color, religion, gender, class, sexual preference?
