Sometimes I like you and sometimes I don't, 
I feel like I'm gonna and then I won't.
Sometimes I wanna live to see a hundred, 
other times I wanna lay down and die. 

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't

Sometimes I'm weak and sometimes I'm strong,
You know that I've loved all along. 
Sometimes I'm rich and sometimes I'm poor, 
nothing really matters when you're dead on the floor.

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't

Sometimes I'm hot and sometimes I'm cold,
other times I feel like I'm getting old. 
Sometimes I'm fast and sometimes I'm slow, 
other times I don't even want to go.

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't

Sometimes I laugh and sometimes I cry, 
other times I sit and wonder why. 
Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down, 
other times I wanna blow this town.

[Chorus:]
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't
