has the power and he's going nowhere,
what is left to ruin?
to the start of something, i'm not buying,
i expect the ruins. you can take my isolation,
also take the pain it brings.
can you move the walls the hold me?
tear them down from everything.
the reason for the grimaced face is what you've had to see.
the other day a story's told to me,
i don't think i listened.
without you things they wouldn't be this way,
can't you make me listen?
think for now i'll fly the seat i fly,
let my imagination grow.
people say i waste my life,
cross my bridges as the burn.
never look back with intentions,
looking back, with no concern.
you coveted what was mine and took my life away.
