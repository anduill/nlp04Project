Johnny is a punk, he don't know what's right
Johnny's going out on the town tonight
Down his local for a couple of pints
And then onto the marquee for the rest of the night

Oh oh, oh oh, punk rocker
Oh oh, oh oh, punk rocker

Johnny is the smartest punk in town
Nobody's gonna put him down
He checks himself, yeah he looks just right
Johnny's going out on the town tonight

He stands there watching his favourite band
A pint of lager in his hand
But he won't dance away the night
'cos johnny likes to stay looking right
