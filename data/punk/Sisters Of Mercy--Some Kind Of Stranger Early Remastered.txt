From England in the morning
I havenґt slept for days
I havenґt kept the promise made
And I know the world is cold
But that if you hold on tight to what you find
You might not mind too much
Though even this must pass away
And memories may last for years
But names are just for souveniers
Let me look into your eyes
And I donґt care what youґre called
Tell me later if at all
I can wait a long, long time before I hear another lovesong
Don't give me whys and wherefores
Reason for surprise
I don't care for words that don't belong

Come here
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful
Angel come inside
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
Yeah, I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
I think, I think youґre beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
Angel come inside
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful, beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here
I think youґre beautiful
I think youґre beautiful, beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
