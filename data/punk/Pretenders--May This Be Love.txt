Waterfall
Nothing can harm me at all
My worries seem so very small
With my waterfall

I can see
My rainbow
Calling me
Through the mysteries
Of my waterfall

Some people say
Daydreams are for all the 
lazy minded fools
With nothing else to do
So let them laugh
Laugh at me
So just as long as I have you
To see me through
I have nothing to lose
Long as I have you

Waterfall
Don't ever change you ways
For with me
For a million years
You're my waterfall
